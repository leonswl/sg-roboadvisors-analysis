This may result in a longer onboarding time compared to the rest but nonetheless I feel that it is better this way. The onboarding experience/ user experience have been great! It is very convenient to find out the percentage of portfolio in the different funds and how each of the funds have been performing. I also loved how they provide access fee credit for referral instead of 6mths of free management fee. It really helps to offset the already low fee cost which help us to make sure more goes into our investment since every dollar counts. Lastly, they regular webinar that they provide really helps me to understand the market better which I have gone through at least half of it the past 2 mths.

I conducted more research into the funds and found that the funds were managed by renowned fund managers who have shown consistent results. The funds were managed by humans despite being a robo-adviser. For those who prefer a human element in your investments due to security reasons, Endowus has fulfilled that. 

Endowus also offers a competitive fees range. The total fees were comparable to the other robo-advisors when you take into account the expense ratio.
