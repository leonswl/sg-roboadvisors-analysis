StashAway: Invest and save,"StashAway is where intelligent investing meets personal finance. 
No minimum balance. No entry fee. No lock-up. No hidden fees. No kidding. 
Imagine how the next 15 minutes of your life could go: You tell us about your financial situation and financial goals. Then, our system designs and recommends an investment plan to reflect your personal preferences and current financial situation. Then, you start investing toward investment plans made just for you. Finally, you have a financial plan that's tailored to you, not the same one that your neighbour and boss have. You smile. You go back to work, or play with the kids. 
Then, later, you can check your investments at any time on your desktop or mobile phone to say ""hi"" to your financial future, or maybe to make changes to your risk level and your deposit plan when you get that raise or bonus. Add more investment plans for each of your financial goals so you have a solid plan. Want to retire? Let's make a savings and investing plan to get you there sooner. Want to send the kids to a great university? Also can! Want to build wealth without a particular goal in mind? Our system will manage that for you, too.
Or, don't check your investments. While you're working, eating, sleeping, vacationing, or chilling out, our system constantly monitors and manages your investments to withstand changing market or economic conditions the long-term. 
Yes, investing can be this easy. And personal finance can be this personal. 
What's the catch? No catch. Here's what's behind the app:
- We charge one simple fee: It's a single all-inclusive annual fee that ranges from 0.2% to 0.8% of your total investment value. That means: No minimum balance, no entry, no lock-up, and no hidden fees. No, we're not kidding. 
- We're fully licensed by the respective authorities in each region
- Behind the screen is a team with decades of experience: our Co-founder and CEO, Michele is the former CEO of ZALORA; our Co-founder and CIO, Freddy, latest post was Managing Director and Global Head of Derivatives Strategy at Nomura; and our Co-founder and CTO, Nino, has founded and scaled multiple global tech companies.
- We have real people to answer your questions. WhatsApp, call, or email us. Whatever works for you works for us.
