Syfe,"1. The portfolio ‚Äúcard user interface‚Äù can be inconvenient if you have multiple portfolio which requires multiple swipe. Would be great if portfolio can be arranged in a vertical view, similar to desktop.

2. Each portfolio has a composition of funds. Would be great if you allow user to sort/filter by investment types and percentage of funds.

3. Each portfolio shows a detailed transaction of buying in and selling equities/bonds/gold. Would be great to have a overall transaction view that allow user to see how much money was transferred to syfe from their bank and how much was withdrawn."
Syfe,"This hybrid app is quite buggy compared Stashaway. However your portfolio make a better profit, the only reason I still using your platform. Please improve your app, at least make it native."
Syfe,"The app and website is just a bunch of fake lies. Starting from onboarding to fund transfer, Syfe tells lies to customer about instant speed but everything is just a lie. I used SG myinfo to fill information. It was advertised as instant option to open account, however they asked for ID proof and residence proof - First fail. Syfe took 2-3 days to open account while they advertised instant account open using myinfo - second fail. They also made me deposit money during account opening process on false promise of immediately putting money to work after instant account opening; but it took full 5 days before money was invested- Third fail. This is the worst platform for investment."
Syfe,The app looks fantastic and it‚Äôs so fresh with the different colors. And so much more content comparing to the previous ones. Keep it up Syfe and I hope to see more upgrades!! üëçüèΩ
Syfe,"Hi there,

The app checks for latest version during launch and alert the user to download the new version. However even after the update is made, the app keep showing the pop up to update the app perhaps the app is updated to latest version. 

Please look into it."
Syfe,"The funds transferred page has issue in the app. The page just turns blank when select ‚Äúbank name‚Äù, ‚Äúamount‚Äù. Attempted several times and still happens. Other than that, the app seems to be fine"
Syfe,"I like that I can have my savings (Cash+) in the same place as my investments, and manage all in the same platform"
Syfe,Kindly archive the fully withdrawn portfolio rather than remain in the main page. Thank you.
Syfe,"Using the app on a iPhone 11 Pro Max. Apparently the app won‚Äôt allow to login except that it just shows a dark blue background. When that happens, my iPhone gets very warm, especially somewhere close to the camera!

Developer need to look into this."
Syfe,The app keeps logging me out after a few mins even if I was actively browsing and or in the middle of a transaction.
Syfe,If your in Singapore living there or working. U need the accurate details otherwise they will not let you start investing. I just hope I can get whatever cash i have given to them back
Syfe,You could do a lot more in terms of dashboard and visualisation of the portfolio
Syfe,Ease of use and good product offered
Syfe,"Nice looking app, easy to use interface and transparency of underlying positions/transactions/fees is good to see."
Syfe,Invested in equity100 and I‚Äôm very satisfied with the performance so far
Syfe,"Since the latest update, the scale of the charts is too large to see the fluctuations in the value of my portfolio. Pls rectify thanks!"
Syfe,"Areas to improve:
- widgets
- needs frequent reinstallation
- UI randomly stays blank
- watching videos get interrupted to relogin
- iOS Settings > Syfe > Crashes"
Syfe,Cannot withdraw money‚Ä¶
Syfe,:)
Syfe,Easy to navigate and clean interface. Recent updates including guides and expert advice are helpful for beginner investors. Hope to see more updates in the future!
Syfe,Maybe allow notifications to notify the user that funds have been received or funds have been invested. Other than that its a great app and extremely wonderful!
Syfe,"Clean interface, very user friendly, a lot of useful functions that allows me to monitor my portfolios and transfer funds easily. A lot of informative educational content as well. Great app!!"
Syfe,"The app is simple and easy to use. 

Suggestion to improve the upload proof function to be able to browse photos in iOS instead of going files when the instruction is to upload a screenshot of the transaction confirmation."
Syfe,"Looks clean and simple, nothing distracting. Ok on mobile but only tiny screen when viewed from iPad. Please look into adding support for bigger screened devices."
Syfe,"Hi, 
This is an amazing app but however I feel like there are always room for improvement. The app crashes quite often and sometimes I can‚Äôt navigate to other options. Please look into it"
Syfe,Super easy to get started and really made it easy to start investing as a beginner. Love the new version with learning content as well
Syfe,"App interface is clunky, particularly having to slide through the portfolios which appear as ‚Äòcards‚Äô on your screen. If you have more than 1 portfolio and want to do a recurring transfer, you need to set up a transfer for each portfolio which is really troublesome. Returns also not fantastic so far vs benchmarks"
Syfe,Easy to check my portfolio few times a week
Syfe,"App crashes very often, please fix it soon üôèüèª"
Syfe,A great service with no minimums. I opened a small account in minutes so I can teach my son about investing. However the app (as 26 Oct) crashes regularly. This needs to be fixed ASAP.
Syfe,"Please put more effort in getting the app with better user experience UI. The app freeze frequently, and it‚Äôs not easy to find information like portfolio allocation of my investment. 

StashAway app can be a good starting point for reference."
Syfe,"App crashes quite often, also feel that the update in the afternoon of our returns isn‚Äôt as accurate. Compared to Stashaway the returns reflected is more accurate."
Syfe,"Very inconsistent app. Keeps crashing, updates are slow and irregular.

Just a key note to people considering this - sign up bonuses are withheld for 6 months! You‚Äôll only know this if you actually bother to read T&Cs which 99.9% of users don‚Äôt have the time to."
Syfe,Managed to log in but faced with a blank screen. Tried to kill the app multiple times but it resurfaces after each launch.
Syfe,Not opening after latest update
Syfe,Just downloaded the app and it prompts me to update to the latest version and link me back to the App Store. Can‚Äôt update from the App Store because I‚Äôm already have the latest version. Please fix. Thanks!
Syfe,The app keeps crashing after I‚Äôve updated the app. Anyone faces the same issue as me?
Syfe,"Can have login by faceID ?

Update 7 April.  

Thanks it works.  5 stars"
Syfe,"Love the simplicity of the app! However, app tends to crash too often. Hopefully it‚Äôll be fixed!"
Syfe,"I can log in via web & handphone browser, but this app doesn‚Äôt allow me to log in using the same password and email address.

I tried to delete and reinstall for few times at different dates 
Restart my handphone
Make sure it‚Äôs the latest version
Updated my password 

I also contacted the customer service team and someone promised will get back to me after their investigation, but I haven‚Äôt received any till now."
Syfe,The app crashes every few minutes. Please fix this
Syfe,Updated the app recently and it has been crashing the moment I start it.
Syfe,"Nice interface and user friendly

However Apps keeps on crashing!! Pls fixed it"
Syfe,Have to wait till 3pm plus to see the latest value based on yesterday market.
Syfe,I still cannot login using the same credentials
Syfe,"Not optimised for ipad? Developers please do look into this, I am sure there are many ipad users out there."
Syfe,Developers pls fix.
Syfe,It takes forever to register for an account on the app. I‚Äôve restarted the app more than 5 times as the pages don‚Äôt load.
Syfe,Not much to say. Had a working app. Now no longer have a working app. When will I have a working app again?
Syfe,"This application crash too often. Please look into this urgently. Btw, why the Lump Sum cannot be set to $0 under the new Future Projections screen?"
Syfe,"I will like to register a account for REITs but eventually not able to do so cos the apps keep crashing 
Greatly disappointed with this"
Syfe,Modern UI but terrible app stability.
Syfe,Just downloaded the app. Tried to launch it and it keeps asking me to update to the latest version. Unusable.
Syfe,Yes the app often crashes while using
Syfe,App frequently crash while using. It is very annoying.
Syfe,"Hello, new to this company and app. Why does the app keeps crashing when I'm navigating?"
Syfe,Pls fix this
Syfe,"the app has a really simple UI interface for easy access to statistics such as returns.

the only thing that i find problematic is that you have to re-login every time you close the app. there should be an implementation of using pin to login for faster access of the app, and not a waiting time of 1 minute just to key in your password & then waiting for the sms with your verification code to arrive."
Syfe,IOS app ask user to update and clicking leads to *drumroll* Google App store.
Syfe,Please fix the app. It keeps crashing
Syfe,Help.
Syfe,App keeps crashing thru out registration. Gave up!
Syfe,This app crashes a lot. I mean A LOT!
Syfe,"After entering username and password the app changes to a blank white screen. I imagine it is waiting for a PIN as I receive an SMS with the PIN. 

The same issue happens on both my iPad and iPhone. 

Useless app."
Endowus,"I had a great experience with Endowus the past (almost) 2 months. Compared to other robo-advisor which lump up all the customer's money/ shares in sub-custodian account, I feel more assured that my share are being held in a personal account with UOB Kay Hian. This may result in a longer onboarding time compared to the rest but nonetheless I feel that it is better this way. The onboarding experience/ user experience have been great! It is very convenient to find out the percentage of portfolio in the different funds and how each of the funds have been performing. I also loved how they provide access fee credit for referral instead of 6mths of free management fee. It really helps to offset the already low fee cost which help us to make sure more goes into our investment since every dollar counts. Lastly, they regular webinar that they provide really helps me to understand the market better which I have gone through at least half of it the past 2 mths. I also really appreciate that they cover ALL topic in the webinar even though it may not be related to Endowus fund (ie understanding ETFs and how to select the right ETFs)."
Endowus,"I‚Äôve been using Endowus since July 2020 and have been gradually increasing my investments over the year. It has a sleek and easy to use interface with lots of options for mutual funds, some of which are ordinarily available to institutional clients. Returns are decent as they are all contingent on when you invest and are pretty sensitive and at the same time resilient to the market  i.e. timing, cycles etc. but would say that mutual funds tend to be long term so you should have that mindset to maximise the use of Endowus."
Endowus,"Endowus has done a great job in providing a much cheaper option to invest our CPF money into various funds (unit trusts). I was generally not a supporter of unit trusts due to its expensive costs. However, Endowus has changed my impression with its trailer fee rebate model. One of the best robo-advisors in SG! However, the interface of the web login can be more user intuitive! And in the future, I hope Endowus can offer more innovative ways using AI to help investors filter out the relevant funds that suit their investment goals."
Endowus,"I choose Endowus as my robo invest platform base on 2 reasons. 
They open an account with UOB Hay Kian using your name for your robo investment. This give me the assurance in the event if Endowus were to close due to unforeseen circumstances, UOB Hay Kian have my account with my investment. 
I can also customize my own portfolio which 
I find it attractive for me as i can choose the funds that i want to invest in rather than majority of the other robo invest which have fixed funds in the portfolio."
Endowus,"If you‚Äôre looking for the HIGHEST earnings for your cash, this is probably not what you‚Äôre looking for. However, if you‚Äôre looking for reliable earnings in a consistent, dollar cost averaging method, through a reliable company that has gained my trust through their transparent video seminars, this is a great app. 

Particularly like how you can invest CPF so easily through this app, and while it‚Äôs not guaranteed, my CPF investment has seen a substantial gains since May 2020. Highly recommended."
Endowus,"Customer since March 2021 and wished I had done it earlier. Love their education online content piece on investing and the Low fee / transparent / passive investing approach. Product is smooth, good tracking of performance (different metrics available like weighted average) Highly recommend to beat inflation (vs your savings account at your bank) and secure your future, especially for expats who don‚Äôt enjoy cpf and need to plan their wealth strategy."
Endowus,"Nice and slick app. Very fast and smooth. Fuss free experience. I only hope more features are brought from web to mobile. Investment wise, it‚Äôs been showing great performance. The access to many funds and their low cost are amazing! I also love how transparent they are about everything, eg fee breakdown, fund rationales. Strongly recommended! (Not just for Singaporean/PR, I‚Äôm a foreigner)"
Endowus,"To be honest, I was hesitant at first to start with Endowus, as my impression of it was that the funds invested were actually mutual funds and I was reading too much into the disadvantages of mutual funds. 

I conducted more research into the funds and found that the funds were managed by renowned fund managers who have shown consistent results. The funds were managed by humans despite being a robo-adviser. For those who prefer a human element in your investments due to security reasons, Endowus has fulfilled that. 

Endowus also offers a competitive fees range. The total fees were comparable to the other robo-advisors when you take into account the expense ratio. 

Endowus definitely needs to improve its App capabilities, but I believe that will come in the future. 

All in all, I would think that Endowus has provided me with a good experience thus far."
Endowus,"A friendly, cost efficient and easy way to grow your investment. The platform is suitable for novice investors to sophisticated investors( who need a one stop diversification and monitoring tool). The highlight of the platform to me is the low cost and transparency of investment. I must say if given an opportunity I wud like to invest in the platform itself:-) There is some room for app improvement but I guess it will happen over time.."
Endowus,"Endowus is my preferred choice of Robo-adviser after reviewing all that is available in the market.

Investment method, personally I favour mutual funds over passive ETF, which I could purchase them myself ( thou some might say it‚Äôs cheaper to get thru robo)

Endowus gives us unique access to top-tier funds managers that traditionally cost a bomb! It‚Äôs also curated for its credits ratings & risk appetite which suits you!"
Endowus,"Originally signed up to get access to Dimensional funds for my SRS. So far getting the best returns out of my other SRS related investments. Email notifications might be a bit too much, but maybe necessary (i.e. upcoming investment, cash/srs received, investment complete), I'm now considering to add more cash related portfolios as well. 

Very helpful and responsive customer support!"
Endowus,"Really like Endowus and how it‚Äôs been so easy to onboard, use and track my investments. Best thing I did for my money especially as interest rates have dropped. The detailed breakdown especially in the web browser is great. Would be good if the app can be just as functional and if an iPad version of the app could be launched."
Endowus,"I‚Äôm an active user of Endowus for more than a year now. The newly introduced Endowus app is awesome and user friendly. Endowus has many great products that are low-cost and provides everyone with cost efficient, transparent, and customizable portfolios. I've introduced to both friends and family, and they are all happy customers of Endowus."
Endowus,"Experience with Endowus is a seamless process with a dashboard and application that is easy to use and very informative. It is a safe platform for me to do my investments and while it might not provide extremely high returns, it provides security with a stable return on your investments. I would highly recommended young investors to try it out too!"
Endowus,Been looking forward to their mobile app since they were previously only available on the web. User interface is really friendly and easy to use. Modern and sleek mobile app! Looking forward to more exciting features from the team!
Endowus,"I‚Äôve been invested with Endowus since Dec 2020 and it has been a fuss-free journey so far with their web and mobile app.

Started with CPF OA and returns has been higher than 2.5% CPF interest rate so I‚Äôm quite pleased with the performance so far.

After monitoring for a few months, I got more comfortable with Endowus so also started a Cash Smart portfolio recently hoping to beat the miserable bank deposit interest rate for my shorter term cash needs. Since it‚Äôs only very recent so can‚Äôt comment much on Cash Smart yet.

Its good that we can invest with different fund sources (OA, cash, SRS) for one goal which make it easy to manage and track."
Endowus,Well designed app and a good place to start investing for beginners. I was looking for means to boost returns (up to 2% p.a. with cash smart) with bank interest rates at a record low level. Smooth onboarding experience. I was able to transfer my funds quickly and without a glitch.
Endowus,"An intuitive, easy to use App with a clean interface. Investment cost was reasonable. Very good overall experience. Would be helpful to have function to switch directly between portfolios. Investment and financial advice were sound and professional. Would be helpful if they are more frequent including views of the latest investment and global financial landscape."
Endowus,"This app complements the Endowus team‚Äôs investing philosophy, which is to make investing easy and available for everyone. The UI is easy to read and understand, and every piece of data is displayed clearly. Best thing is, I can fulfill all my investment needs all under one platform with cash, SRS and CPF!"
Endowus,"Clean interface, smooth user experience and quick loading times. This first release is a beautiful and functional product. Has clearly raised the bar on what a Fintech app should look and feel like in South East Asia. Other companies should watch and learn. Great job team!"
Endowus,"I had been EndowUS user before the app is launch. Although the web is fine but the app make the whole experience better, sleek design ensure good use experience. It‚Äôs easy to check balance and performance data, investment has never been any simpler."
Endowus,"Nice, sleek and easy to use. Good UX and UI. Similar to the website which I really like for its simplicity. 

There might be a bug on the More section where the account and preferences doesn‚Äôt seem to work. Minor issue as we now have an App to conveniently track our investments. 

Glad I‚Äôm with Endowus. Keep it up!"
Endowus,"Endowus has truly been a seamless way for myself to get into investing. Quality content (blog and webinar), useful investment instruments, trailer fee rebates, clean and intuitive browser and mobile UI UX are just some of the benefits they offer. Oh yes, the only fully digital investor for CPF at the moment too!"
Endowus,"Though I usually interface using the browser instead of the app, am glad that the app is well thought out, and offers a consistent user experience from the browser."
Endowus,"I mainly utilise the Endowus app to take quick glances of my portfolio. It offers a good overview of my account and links to the website for more advanced functions. Overall, I like the clean design and ease with which I can navigate the basic features."
Endowus,I have been using Endowus for more than year and gradually earning more and more with my saving. With simple and straightforward UI make users to use easily and easy to get information by using app. I strongly recommend you to grow your asset
Endowus,"Endowus is a great roboadvisor to invest your cash, CPF and SRS funds in Singapore. You can choose from curated investment portfolios based on your risk tolerance or create a portfolio by selecting from a basket of different funds (unit trusts). Furthermore, the fees to invest with Endowus are very affordable. The iPhone application for Endowus is simple, sleek and easy to navigate."
Endowus,"Endowus is my preferred choice of Robo-adviser. Firstly, Enodwus give me peace of mind knowing that my investment is custodised individually in my own name at UOB Kay Hian. Secondly, Endowus gives me unique access to top-tier funds managers that traditionally cost a bomb. Lastly, Endowus is the only robo advisor that allows me to manage my cash, CPF and SRS funds in one platform."
Endowus,"I like that it‚Äôs easy to use and the platform is also easy to understand. It‚Äôs offers different option in either in investing in cash, cpf and even srs accounts. Can‚Äôt wait to see the portfolio grows‚Ä¶"
Endowus,"I have tried three robo-advisors over the past year and by far EndowUs is the platform that gave me the highest, most consistent returns. To top that, the platform is incredibly easy to use and the customer service is top-notch!"
Endowus,Easy to sign up. I am also able to invest and view my portfolios easily with FaceID login. Hoping that more features will be added in natively into the mobile app in the future!
Endowus,"User friendly website and app, good product offering, transparent pricing, prompt customer service and good engagement with clients through webinars. Most importantly, funds performance has been satisfactory!"
Endowus,A reliable and user-friendly investment platform that makes investing a breeze. Well designed and intuitive interface as well.
Endowus,Endowus App empowers retailed investors with access to institutional funds with low cost. It allows us to dollar cost average on investments. I am happy with how easy to make investments with  low fees and achieve financial goals for the long run.
Endowus,"The mobile app is easy to use, endowus as a brand is also known for its low and fair fees and  transparency. Customer service is also top notch. Def recommend giving it a try!"
Endowus,I'm a newbie to investment and I was checking out few other Robo advisors app and decided to go with Endowus is because the app is so easy to navigate and making investment less complicated. Recommended for newbie investors.
Endowus,Love the interface and the simplicity - i tried other platforms and this is something I prefer over the rest
Endowus,"Smooth login through FaceID and clean interface. Easy to use and convenient to check status/ balances on the go. Confident in the investment philosophy and returns for all my money, and for the long term. Go Endowus!!"
Endowus,Easy to use investment apps. Not much to navigate around. Recommended. Everyday update of performance. Not to get worries on the lump sum deposit that are reflected part by part into the account.
Endowus,"It is the cheapest robo advisor of those that invest in unit trusts. I love that It is also the only robo advisor that allows me  to invest my cash and CPF or SRS funds. I love the fact that Endowus does not charge users fees for opening or closing accounts, fund transfers or withdrawals."
Endowus,"Dimensional funds is great, thanks to everyone on the team for this. Also excellent overall customer support on technical issues and investment advice."
Endowus,Simple to use platform. Varied options yet limited fees. Responsive team if you need to contact them. Great experience overall!
Endowus,"Like the platform, all Cpf, cash and Srs investment in one platform. Easy to use and I like the good flexibility! Hope more enhancement coming along to make it better in future"
Endowus,I‚Äôve been using the web for a while. And so glad to have the app to check my investment. This app is so intuitive! And even beautiful!
Endowus,"User friendly interface, straight to the point features. Will continue using it"
Endowus,"Been a web user for a while and noticed it has an app now. Tried the app and I am loving it already. Thanks, team!"
Endowus,"Portfolio return is satisfying. Customer support staffs are very friendly. Very user friendly, suitable for a wide range of age gp user."
Endowus,Long waited app been waiting for since signing up with them. Great company helping me to growth my wealth wisely. Would recommend to others.
Endowus,The app is smooth and easy to navigate. The experience with Endowus has been great and able to invest my cpf for better return!
Endowus,Endowus makes investing easy for busy investors. I love the transparency and the added security of investing through UOB Kay Hian account. The app is very user-friendly too.
Endowus,"Upon logon app asks for preferred method. Choose FaceID 
Next time you logon again same is asked :(
Shouldn‚Äôt it remember and prompt FaceID?

Next, dont like redirecting to browser mode upon most of menu clicks. They should be built within the app itself"
Endowus,The app is easy to use and user friendly. So far have been happy with the returns and I am confident about placing investments with Endowus
Endowus,I‚Äôll give 5 stars if most of the functionality is ported to app instead of webview
Endowus,Was excited to try out the app after using endowus on web for a year now! Super user friendly and helps make investing a breeze.
Endowus,Seamless sign up experience and really easy to configure and setup my first portfolio. I setup both a SRS investment portfolio and a Cash management portfolio.
Endowus,It is really easy to use and I got on-boarded seamlessly. Looking forward to the great return with Endowus!
Endowus,Highly recommended for investing in institutional fund with low fee. They are the only fintech now that CPF board permit to use our CPFOA to invest in S&P500.
Endowus,"I have been invested with them for more than a year, and now invest most of my SRS and CPF OA funds;
Good products at a good price."
Endowus,"Since the update 2 days ago, the app cannot be opened. Pressing the app literally shows a white screen and auto minimising"
Endowus,Gd enough app. What is more important are their financial investment products which has been working great for me.
Endowus,The mobile app is sleek and well designed.
Endowus,"Love the fact that you can invest your CPF, SRS and cash all in one place and at lower fees!"
Endowus,The app is sleek and simple to use. Customer service is also good. I have been using it to invest my CPF OA. :)
Endowus,Easy to use üëçüèª
Endowus,"Endowus is the first robo advisor that I started using that allows me to use CPF, SRS as sources of investment. Fuss free and good for lower risk profiles."
Endowus,One of the best robo advisors out there offering curated portfolios that are backed by evidence.
Endowus,"Fast setup, good returns, seamless signup. What more to expect?"
Endowus,Super easy to use. Great apps !!
Endowus,Easy to use. Return is good.
Endowus,Endowus is a great investment platform for newbies to investment. They also provide many useful video in youtube to educate the users on long-term investment. customer service has been great so far as well. They are able to respond to enquiry quickly and helps to resolve issue very quickly.
StashAway,"Allows for investments across broad asset classes and different geographies at your own preferred/targeted risk level. Fuss free consistent dollar cost averaging can be set up easily. Major plus point of being a well designed mobile app with clear user interface. 

Client engagement team is helpful and replies to queries quickly. Especially important when you have any questions or technical issues. 

Great educational content on the app and through webinars as well. Content ranges from the basic financial planning to market updates or Stashaway‚Äôs investment framework. I enjoy the technical content, since you might want to know the framework in which your money is being deployed. New podcast also producing interesting financial content with external speakers. Encourage people to check that out too."
StashAway,"I started investing in Stashaway a few months ago and i am amazed by how well they managed my money. I love how i could just adjust the risk to whatever that i prefer and comfortable with and it is absolutely fuss free. The app is absolutely easy to use especially for beginners like me. Moreover, the team managing stashaway is really helpful and will answer to any questions that i have asked within just a few hours. Also, the programmes provided by stashaway is really helpful for beginners like me as i am able to learn more about investing in the market, the risk, the volatility of the market, economic conditions and many more.
I would definitely recommend investing in stashaway for those who is interested in investing but not sure where to start."
StashAway,"Stashaway is a simple, intriguing and effective investment solution for an individual's investment needs / goals. It is a roboadvisor in Singapore that does more than being ""robotic"" and just ""mindlessly"" taking individuals' money and passing on to the ETFs managers and making a fee in return. I do appreciate the customer support and how they are very much willing to engage us in every step they take as well as explaining the rationale behind their decisions. Stashaway's Economic Regime-based asset allocation framework shines over the long run, especially now when we have seen mulitple years of good markets and evidently in this current downturn, their asset allocation strategy has certainly protected investors' capital much better than other platforms that are static in their asset allocation."
StashAway,"In terms of user experience, it was great. The platform is, in my opinion, the easiest to use across 2 of the robo-advisors that I have used. It allows you to see your holdings at one glance. Not only that, it allows for having more than 1 portfolio in the same risk percentage which is great. 

Similarly, in terms of returns, I have been seeing double digit returns for both my 26% and 30% risk accounts and its been great. For a robo-advisor to be able to achieve those returns are outstanding. 

Lastly, the customer service experience is excellent. With just a whatsapp, you could get your questions answered. No more waiting on robo live chats etc. You get an actual person on the other line servicing you. Of course, sometimes it takes a while, but it helps not staying on the page and refreshing it, which makes everything a lot easier. 

Overall, a very satisfied customer who has been contributing monthly to my account, mainly because of the % returns, but also because of the whole package of ease and comfort (AND OF COURSE, RETURNS) Stashaway offers."
StashAway,"User + Onboarding Experience
I was comparing quite a few robot advisory platforms before finally deciding on StashAway and the top reason is really the user experience. The interactive onboarding (I love the little question marks explaining certain technical concepts!) goes through your personal goals and recommends suitable levels and makes everything easy from general lay-out of your asset allocation to the periodic deposit plans.

Customer Service + Investment Direction
Customer service was quick to respond on different matters, both urgent and trivial, and was extremely patient. With the exception of weekends, you can usually expect a response in a few hours. (With the latest updates to customer service, even weekends are good to go now!)

I'm a rookie investor and really don't wish to devote extra time on active asset allocation so this passive method works best for me. I do think the max cap of 36% risk index is quite interesting and could be daunting for higher-risk individuals (though then again, these folks might be more engaged actively investing their money)."
StashAway,"StashAway offers multiple portfolios with a wide range of risk index so there is bound to be one that fits your risk appetite. All of the ETFs that are in the portfolios have been picked by StashAway so you won‚Äôt be able to change them. Not an issue for me as I‚Äôm a new investor and not much into active investing/stock picking. 

StashAway is a great tool to help new investors build up good investing habits and allows them to be exposed & get used to the ups & downs of the stock market with a small initial capital.

Overall, the StashAway app has a great interface and it‚Äôs very user-friendly. It‚Äôs easy to navigate and find the info you want."
StashAway,"Love the user-friendly interface as it‚Äôs very intuitive to use, even for beginners. There are educational resources as well which is a huge bonus to those who are absolutely clueless on how to start; I personally found them really helpful and the nice graphics are a plus point. The customisation of goal-based targets is a really nice touch as well :) 

Funds are usually deposited in 3 days (though it usually takes way less time from my experience). Customer support is superb as well, you‚Äôre able to chat them up on whatsapp and the replies are really prompt and helpful! Highly recommended!"
StashAway,"As a beginner to investing, swamped by too much advice I cannot simply trust, StashAway gives something different - a focus on investor education, strong customer service and backed by a strong, transparent and resilient investment team that I trust. It is a robo-advisor, but led by a capital markets veteran. As a software startup, it holds strong technology experience in CEO and CTO. Strong team, clear aligned vision, and scaling responsibly.

I may not yet understand everything about investing, but I can safely say this - StashAway holds my gold chip, and I am happy to have found them early on my journey to walk the Long road together.

Thank you StashAway and high recommendation !"
StashAway,"As a young beginner investor, (Im 20) I was not sure of how to start financial but stashaway is a great all-in-one app to get started in an all rounded portfolio investment and the great part is that you can choose the risk levels that you are entering.

The team provides updates frequently through videos in the app so that really helped me understand where I am putting my money and what‚Äôs going on in the market without having to really understand the technical parts of investing. This and the emails that I get every now and then provide a good engagement for me :)

For one step further, Stashaway also provides podcasts and educational talks for those who would like to find out more about how to invest and save for financial planning. 

I really enjoy the app function of this roboinvesting and after comparing stashaway to other roboinvesters, I can confidently say that stashaway is the better one out there and the company I‚Äôve chosen to trust with my savings."
StashAway,"[User Experience] The user experience is among the best a few robos I've ever used. They have a nice and elegant mobile apps as well as an easy to use website.  As a beginner, I learned a lot of useful information from the insights articles and their weekly video updates (they have weekly comments on the financial markets and answer questions in a 10 minutes video) , quite helpful. The portfolio creation and management is also quite intuitive and transparent.

[Customer Support] I've contact them by email and by WhatsApp. They address my questions well.

[Onboarding Experience] Easy and quick.

[Investment Method] They have goal-based, general investing, income portfolio etc, and you can choose your risk level as well. The highest is 36%. They use a bunch of ETFs to config the portfolio.

[Others] Currently the fee ratio is 0.8%, including everything. A good choice if you know little about investment but want to grab the recent market opportunities."
StashAway,"Have always wanted to invest but didn‚Äôt know how or where. Did a lot of research and finally took the plunge to start investing with Stashaway. You choose your risk profile and they invest in a portfolio of ETFs for you. Great user interface and experience every step of the way, was also able to get above market returns having used them for the past 2 years. I recommend this to all my friends because it‚Äôs an easy platform to start saving up for your future and their referral reward is pretty good too!"
StashAway,"Stashaway is my first roboinvesting platform and the performance, user interface and customer service were so good and easy to use for anyone who is new to it. It is made easy to manage the amount in each of your portfolio.

They were also consistently sending out monthly advice to update on the situation and their actions. I find that very reassuring especially during the COVID period.

It has been 3 years since I started with Stashaway and it is still my main roboinvesting platform."
StashAway,"As someone who don‚Äôt know much about investment, stashaway is simple and great for beginners. You just have to decide the risk exposure you are willing to take and StashAway will do the investment for you. Which also means you are unable to decide on the where to invest. They will do readjustment of your portfolio so can leave it as it is and let them handle it. The app is user friendly and easy to use, goal projections are transparent so I feel safe to invest my money through stashaway. 

Recommended for other beginners like me."
StashAway,"It is a great platform for beginner investor since you can just DCA into the account and let the algorithm do the job. You will not need to worry about the selling and buying when the share prices go up/down so you can sleep well at night.

The only downside is that you will not be able to choose what to buy but you can choose your risk profile. 

One thing I really like about StashAway is that the transactions are really smooth and fast. Transferring money in to invest are usually complete within 1-2 days."
StashAway,"Downloaded this app in 2018 and have been using it since. Not once has it lagged or crashed on me. 

With the ability to buy fractional shares, it makes it very compelling to do a small top up whenever there is a market discount. Plus the top ups are pretty fast too!

If I had one suggestion: do a podcast/webinar on how Stashaway keeps our assets safe in the event the company closes down. That is the number one concern of my friends who are considering using this app. Thanks!"
StashAway,"I used StashAway general investment portfolio and got a little profit and wanted to withdrawn the funds, it took them 5 days to process the withdrawn and by the time I received the money, My portfolio becomes a lost due to market change and FX fluctuations as explained by the CS.
I don‚Äôt understand what is the point of showing my portfolio earnings if your final withdrawn amount is not within my control at all, this means that once I submit my withdrawal request, technically all your earnings can become loss in 5 days, how am I supposed to predict the market change and FX in 5 days and that is the exact reason why I want to withdraw now. 
Not going to use the service any more, the earning is not within my control at all"
StashAway,"Stashaway has really impressed me with its clean and smooth interface that is very beginner friendly. It also offers a wide range of range of education on investing so as to help beginners to make better decisions. The engagement team has also been really helpful in answering any doubts and queries that i have faced. Overall, this app is a definitely a 5 star for me and I will definitely recommend this app to the people around me who are interested to start investing."
StashAway,"As a total newbie to investment, stashed away helped me to put my money (money that would otherwise be rotting away in the bank) to great use. 
Their educational material also helped me to familiarise myself with the world of investing, it also helped me make sense of all the financial jargon that investors throw around all the time.
Overall, I‚Äôd say that stashed away is a great platform for new investors looking to make their money work harder, or for busy people who are looking for long term investments."
StashAway,"This is a follow up review. My StashAway experience continues to improve as time goes. The StashAway team seem to improve their offerings & service day by day and have come a long way since they started a few years ago. 

The returns have been consistent for me & I do feel that I have good security of principal. StashAway is taking sincere efforts to teach regarding the basics of investment & financial planning! 

The team is always happy to answer your questions & is easily accessible to you."
StashAway,"great roboinvestor app that allows me to allocate my money as I want. The app is as good as the desktop version and is fully accessible to all the features

the client engagement is also quick and efficient as I have had some enquires in the past which were quickly solved through contacting their team via WhatsApp 

they also have educational programmes on their website to teach the general public how to invest appropriately and what their app invests in!"
StashAway,"Been investing in stashaway for a year, i am a super aggressive risk profile so the returns for my portfolio is significant. During the covid-19, my portfolio showed a bog decline but the team had quickly rebalanced my portfolio again. I didn‚Äôt stop doing my monthly investment in stashaway during covid-19, it takes about a week time to make my investement on track again. Those who has excess money and no idea what to do, can try using stashaway, it is safe and user friendly."
StashAway,"Stashaway makes the robo-investing process simple. It‚Äôs app is easy to use, the customer support is top notch and very prompt even when contacted via email and the educational material available via its stashaway academy and online articles have helped me understand more principles behind investing! 
One minor gripe is the inability to copy the account number that i need to transfer money into from the app. It‚Äôs a small inconvenience but other than that the app is great!"
StashAway,"[Onboarding Experience] Account set-up was fairly simple and fast! Able to skim through all those fill up details by using MyInfo! 

[Returns Rate] I've been using this Stashaway app since Aug 2019 and consistently deposit a fixed amount each month as a DCA investment. And i'm on a positive return which surprises me too! After their re-optimisaton last time, i'm sitting on a +5.69% (money weighted) / +2.88% (time weighted) return. 

[Customer Support] Customer support is relatively fast. I've had issues previously with changing my risk level, and whatsapp them. Received back a reply soon enough with a good explanation. 

[Investment Method] Stashaway has been re-optimising their portfolio and going into the China market and slightly away from the US. Which i like as now, i have an exposure to the BAT stocks."
StashAway,"Was recommended by a friend around 2yrs ago and been constantly growing my investments in StashAway since then thanks to consistent performance and intuitive and easy to use interface. Wish they can start allowing certain clients to have [even a small] say in the products/geographies to invest in, besides choosing a risk category.
Overall super satisfied with StashAway and will continue to recommend this."
StashAway,"In my opinion, this app is super easy to use and navigate! I took a few minute to set up an account, just a few clicks here and there and wallah it‚Äôs done!  Also, for a newbie to investment, Stashaway provides educational content at every steps. It‚Äôs a good feature as I‚Äôm able to learn and understand what am I investing and so on. Stashaway also hold several webinar and even podcast! Overall, I really love the experience with stashaway!"
StashAway,"Overall, the whole app experience was a good one as every instructions was quite clear and straightforward. Your client engagement team has been very helpful and responsive towards all of my request. There‚Äôs also occasional email regarding tips on the current market and how to earn more on your StashAway academy and podcast. It‚Äôs a very good information for us to know more on what‚Äôs happening so far."
StashAway,"App is user friendly, and relatively bug free. Users are able to easily access their various portfolios and view the portfolio composition. Would be great if more details could be provided (perhaps via a tooltip) on the way the returns are calculated.

On the whole, would also be beneficial for StashAway to have information on the ETFs used for the varying risk profiles on their website. This information used to be easily available but no longer."
StashAway,"I have been using the app since 2017 and saw many features /products being developed , which is really beneficial to user. If you don‚Äôt know what investment product to select , just indicate your risk level, app will automatically create your portfolio. But for transfer money in , hope there will be an integrated solution within the app, rather than opening banking app and transfer with comment to identify my fund. Thank you!"
StashAway,"I‚Äôm very satisfied with the easy to navigate user interface. DCA funds also process quite quickly (within 24 hours based on my experience). It also provides in-app webinars, articles and monthly updates which allow you to gain more financial knowledge. I haven‚Äôt tried the withdrawal feature yet so I‚Äôm unable to comment on how quickly it gets processed."
StashAway,"[User Experience] user experience of the app is generally good, with minimal hiccups and the statistics presented are easy to read 

[Investment Method] as a beginner investor, I chose to start with robo investing to help me make the decisions needed to diversify my portfolio based on the risk profile I selected. Basically it is - put in money and relax. 

[Returns Rate] This robo investor focuses a lot of the US market. Surprisingly it has done well for the past year and I am quite happy with it."
StashAway,"Very good investment approach for retail investors who are busy lazy. Such simple investment approach where allocation has been properly set up is the cheapest and easiest way you can invest your money in a diversified classes of assets across regions and sectors. Way better than putting money in bank account and do nothing about it.

You can find asset allocation and investment portfolio in the app and it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand."
StashAway,"Onboarding:
Smooth process for creation of account where we can link via singpass to create the account. The investment portfolio is chosen through questionnaire to determine risk tolerance. Higher risk level can be unlocked after doing a test.

Investment Process:
One of the main thing I really like about StashAway is under their FAQ part of their website, there‚Äôs a write up and rational for the different assets they invest in. This is important especially when you are interested to know why certain decision were made

Cons:
My biggest gripe is the custodian account is not under individual user name unlike other robo advisors out that. Would be the perfect app if they can do that!

Thanks!

All in all, recommended"
StashAway,"Stashaway is my first attempt at using Robo Advisors but it‚Äôs intuitive layout, clear instructions and low barriers to entry made the process very seamless. It is also transparent in terms of what you are getting into and any subsequent updates. I also remember the customer support team being extremely helpful and quick to respond on various channels which makes me more at ease."
StashAway,"I have just started using StashAway services early this year! The app is really easy to navigate with informative descriptions and instructions. I have once whatsapp into customer service as I face issue with the deposit but I got a prompt reply and it was resolve quickly. Apart from the regular newsletter, there are many knowledgeable write ups that are straightforward and easy to understand"
StashAway,"Investing is a very daunting process to newbies, and for people who want to dabble but yet do not have the time to take a hands-on approach with investing, roboadvisors are a great option. Decided to go with StashAway after reading several reviews and recommendations from friends, and so far I‚Äôve been impressed with the seamless experience and of course, positive returns ‚ó°Ãà . Will definitely recommend it for passive investors like myself!"
StashAway,"Been using StashAway for over a year. The app is easy to use, navigate and gives really decent returns.

StashAway simple is also an alternative for beginners who are looking for a place to park their money apart from conventional bank accounts.

Overall, fantastic application and service. Would recommend to anyone who wants to start investing but have no idea how to."
StashAway,"My experience with StashAway has been the most exceptional. 

I remember looking for a robo-advisor to start my investing journey, and was stump by the many options that were available. However, a quick research proved that StashAway was the choice for me. Reason being that, 

1) it offered the exposure to global ETFs with a comprehensive overview of asset allocation along with fractional share investing, which was hard to do as a retail investor

2) the low fees was a attraction point

3) StashAway academy. A free financial academy that seeks to educate users on their route of investing and financial planning

I highly recommend StashAway for anyone who is looking to start their inverting journey with a platform that is so enjoyed and recommend by many other users, including me."
StashAway,"Having extra cash on hand and looking for someplace to store it to earn passive income? Look nowhere as StashAway is the best in the market where you can place your funds there and do not need to worry on how to manage it.

Perfect for individuals who are starting out on their investment journey and looking to take their first step into investing"
StashAway,"As a young investor, not knowing much about investing, StashAway is a perfect platform to kickstart your investment journey. It has a very user-friendly app that you are able to create an account and manage your portfolio via the app alone. 

The StashAway team will constantly provide updates via e-mail on any re-optimization of your portfolio and also of any upcoming podcast which you may benefit from listening to as well. 

There are a number of videos and articles on the app to help guide you if you have just started out investing. Personally, I have benefited from these videos and articles to gain more insights on investing and personal finance. 

I am very appreciative of how simple yet effective StashAway is."
StashAway,"I‚Äôve been using Stashaway for more than 2 years and enjoyed the overall experience. The Stashaway team provides regular updates on their view of the markets and introduced the portfolio re-optimisation feature, which gives me the assurance that the team takes care of my investments and goes the extra mile to educate users on about investing."
StashAway,"Very simple way to get invested and diversified portfolio. As compared to ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù it‚Äôs a lot simpler. You do not need to worry about complex and confusing pricing structure. App navigation is well organized and I love the Face ID login! 

Have been investing with them for a few months now, very pleasant experience so far. Customer service is responsive and provide quality reply as well!"
StashAway,"Stashaway is easy to set up from the get go. The app allows for recurring monthly transactions to set up a dollar cost averaging strategy. You have the freedom to select a risk level that you are comfortable with.

Their portfolios are well diversified and are optimised when necessary. Thus far, the portfolio I am using for over a year has been performing well with good returns.

Stashaway also offers educational webinars and regular market update videos which provides an overview of what is happening in the world today and helps everyday people to understand market movements better.

Stashaway support via Email and WhatsApp has been responsive and always ready to help."
StashAway,"Really good for beginners, very interesting how they choose to describe risk level as how much you‚Äôre willing to lose.

As a beginner myself, it‚Äôs really good that they provide educational materials in the app itself. With videos from the StashAway academy and the podcast, I‚Äôm able to understand a lot easier what investment is all about and the different types of assets that the roboadvisor will invest for you."
StashAway,"The UI of the app is made very simple to understand and use. The client engagement team has also been very prompt with their replies whenever I have enquiries. Being new to financial planning, Stashaway‚Äôs educational materials have also helped me make wiser decisions. 

Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied with this app and I would recommend the app to anyone new to investing or are passively investing."
StashAway,"The app is very easy to use and navigate. I can easily keep track of my portfolio performance. I haven't faced any issues with the app, hence I have yet spoken to the client engagement team. As an investing klutz, the educational videos are helpful in giving me basic knowledge about the investing world. I will highly recommend this app to my friends who are interested in investing."
StashAway,"I‚Äôve been using Stashaway for more than 2 years now, and I can say they are one of the best when it comes to autocorrection. It is very obvious how significant their autocorrection algorithm is to stop losses, and to bounce back in matters of weeks. Kudos! My personal portfolio has grown over 10% in total over 2 years. This is an incredible, incredible platform. :)"
StashAway,Sign up was a breeze. The application interface is good and easy to navigate around. Tons of videos on the platform for beginners to learn about investment. Customer support is great and it is so easy to get help through the whatsapp message feature. Portfolio performances have been good. I love that they give a free trial managing for new sign ups and I hope the managing fee will be reduced.
StashAway,Stashaway has been my one-stop solution in storing all my cash. It‚Äôs so fuss-free and easy where the roboadvisor does it‚Äôs job of helping me manage my funds and to invest as well! Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to start investing and encourage them to use this as a platform to begin their investing journey.
StashAway,"They provide various classes for beginners in investing that are easy to understand, to help us get a better idea of what investing is

Furthermore, the app is interactive and provides insight on where your money is being allocated to. And lastly, there isn‚Äôt a withdrawal fee, hence allowing unlimited withdrawals from your various accounts"
StashAway,"1) The app experience

The most easier robo-advisor app I‚Äôve tried, the design is decent, user friendly & it‚Äôs great for beginner like me to use. 
 
 2) Client engagement team

Credit to the team! They are doing a great job, usually when I have questions, I would text them on WhatsApp, so far their respond was quick. I never get disappointed at all! Gooood! 

 3) Educational programmes 

I‚Äôm glad to have a platform that allows us as a beginner to learn more about investment. Thank you StashAway for giving us so much opportunities to learn! 

So far I have 3 portfolios with SA, I will never stop using it! It‚Äôs just simply amazing! Highly recommended! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
StashAway,"The account was easy to set up, and the interface is very intuitive to use. I contacted the customer support once and they took a reasonable amount of time to carry out my request. StashAway made it very easy for me to start investing while I build up the knowledge to start doing things on my own."
StashAway,"I‚Äôve been using it for a few months now and I like what I‚Äôm seeing. 
Easy sign up process, awesome app interface, nice breakdown to show what exactly was bought with your money. If you‚Äôre new to investing and not sure how to pick individual stocks yourself, but want to invest your money somewhere, this is a great app to start."
StashAway,Great robotadvisor to use as both beginner and experienced investor. Choose between different risk tolerances and your portfolio will be built surrounding it upon depositing funds. Low cost compared to other robot advisors and brokers as well. There are multiple educational tools to read up and learn more on finance. Highly recommended!
StashAway,"Without StashAway, I would probably have delayed starting my investment journey for a few more years. Could not recommend a better product for the completely green investor. The UX is well designed and easy to use, and I really appreciated how the app walked me through the T&C and helped me understand what I was agreeing to."
StashAway,"Great app for beginners new to investing. The app interface is very easy to use and understand. Had an issue and spoke to the customer support on WhatsApp and they were very prompt and helpful. Really useful tips and insights sent via email too! Keeps me as a newbie to investing up to date with financial news, highly recommend :)"
StashAway,"As a newbie in investing, Stashaway made it simple to sign up. The products shared were also simple and straight forward. Customer support reached out quickly when they realized my application was incomplete. It took 1 day for funds to enter my account which is really quick. It was a pleasant experience to kickstart my investment journey!"
StashAway,I have been using stashaway for quite awhile now. It is an easy to use app. The processes are fast and easy to understand. Besides that they also send email regularly to keep you updated with the app and news. Highly recommend the app.
StashAway,"I haven't used any other investment platforms like Auto wealth or opened a CDP account or anything like that, but have been with Stashaway for almost 3 years now. Have been quite pleased with them. Good customer service, easy-to-use and intuitive UI design, and have made decent enough returns, at least to me."
StashAway,Stashaway is a great platform for beginner trying to start their investment. Can transfer fund to investment account without any worries and it will auto invest and buying funds/stocks. Have invested around 6 months and I can see a good profile in my account! Good to hold for long term investment at least 3 - 5 years for better profits.
StashAway,"StashAway is the first Robo-Advisor that I tried out. With its user-friendly interface, dedicated videos on investing and prompt WhatsApp customer service, it soothes my apprehension about investing. I started out with a 12% risk profile portfolio but have gathered sufficient trust and confidence to open up another 36% risk profile portfolio. Thank you, StashAway!"
StashAway,"Just started using Stashaway earlier in 2020 through the recommendation of my relative. The app interface is very intuitive and easy to understand.

Stashaway‚Äôs client engagement team and online resources (articles, videos etc) are super helpful especially for a rookie investor like myself! Highly recommend!"
StashAway,"Was introduced to this via a friend, the app surprised me with its simple UI. Have been using this app for more than 6months, and have seen some returns. The process for withdrawals has also been quite open and fast :) would feel that returns might not be as much as buying individual stocks via sgx etc but its definitely worth a try for lazy investors üòÇ"
StashAway,I‚Äôm currently still not actively investing and this is a great app for me to be exposed to it since there‚Äôs also a lot of educational materials in it! User friendly and they respond fast to queries on WhatsApp. Would recommend to my friends but most of them are already on here :)
StashAway,"Definitely one of the more user friendly UIs out there. Without prior experience or academic learning, it 'limits' the amount of risk you are allowed to take. I am one of those, thus I have a very stable portfolio. Would definitely recommend especially to the newest of people who are afraid of start. Muhammad Sulaiman"
StashAway,Been using stashaway for 3 months now. Impressed with their investing methodology and their asset allocation recommendation given my risk level indicated. Great way for passive investing and dollar cost averaging. Funds were quick to process and returns up till now are very satisfactory. App has great user interface too.
StashAway,"The setup might take a while since you have to choose the portfolio and you have to contemplate which risk level to choose. However, the app itself is very easy to use. All the information you want to see as overview are also shown."

StashAway,"I‚Äôm largely happy with how auto-pilot this app runs. Whenever money is transferred from your bank/CPF account, they‚Äôll email you and notify you. The app is also consistently refreshed to reflect the latest amount of money in your portfolio. The only thing I‚Äôm not that happy about is that you can‚Äôt hand pick anything in your portfolio as it‚Äôs all automated."
StashAway,The first platform I used to start my investing journey. The interface is cool and easy for me to navigate. They have plenty of education videos and materials which is useful. Been 2 years now and the compounding effect indeed showing. Hope they have new feature launching soon.
StashAway,"It‚Äôs a great platform for easy investing, especially when you don‚Äôt have the time to look at individual markets for yourself. Also great for individuals with all risk levels as well. Income portfolio is unique and helps diversify your money on local and Asian bonds, REITS and equities. Customer service is easy to contact too!"
StashAway,Started my StashAway journey this year. I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my experience. Everything from the on boarding process to the portfolio selection to the monthly statements has been well thought through. The app itself is also very reliable.
StashAway,"Started using StashAway last year, while the markets were hitting all-time highs. 

Since then, although I did experience a noticeable drop in my portfolio value, StashAway was able to help me claw back my gains. 

My portfolio is now back in the positive, something quite amazing imo, given the fact that most of the components of the portfolio like the US stocks, are still mostly negative. I wonder just how much more positive my portfolio would be if they were neutral or positive! 

Plus, they handled the communication really well by explaining how they handled everything, through their emails and all."
StashAway,"If you are new to investing and want more customisation than roboadvisors from Banks like DBS, you can try Stashaway.
They have different risk index from 10 to 36 per cent while DBS has 4 or 5.
Overall, quite pleased with their transparency and customer service.
Do know what you are getting into."
StashAway,"I started using StashAway a few months ago and I must say, it‚Äôs really intuitive and makes investing hassle free. 

They show you what they invest for you, the returns from each of the ETFs and how much your portfolio is worth now. For those who wanna start investing, I‚Äôd recommend StashAway."
StashAway,The app allows for investment in a broad range of assets classes and geographies which would have been harder for an individual investor to achieve. It also has a user friendly interface that would help first-time investors to get started more quickly.
StashAway,"The app is quite nice, very user-friendly. Every function is clear. Customer service is very very nice, respond very quickly. Educational videos are also helpful. I like the weekly commentary part the most, it's a direct way to get familiar with the financial markets each week."
StashAway,Enable amateurs to have a feel of investing and provide sufficient protections to those who are not well versed in investing by setting up compulsory courses to go through at our own time. Efficient support team and always willing to answer to any of my queries and go the extra mile! Good job :)
StashAway,Been using stashaway for 2 months now. Impressed with their investing methodology and their asset allocation recommendation given my risk level indicated.

Recommended!
StashAway,Stashaway is great way for new investors to step into the investing world effortlessly. One can start investing with pretty much as low as $100 a month and you are able to tweak your risk appetite accordingly. The user experience is seamless with its friendly and intuitive interface.
StashAway,"The processing of fees turnaround time is quite quick.

The UI is great as it is easily accessible which funds go into your portfolio‚Äôs asset allocation and at what levels. They also show you the individual performance of each asset.

StashAway,"So far it‚Äôs very straightforward, no need to stress up to keep searching what stocks to buy and etc. These robo advisors will do its job, but then... you will be experiencing a delay of withdrawal your money from your stash wallet, takes within 4/5 working days to bank in your account, that‚Äôs the bad thing, but overall it‚Äôs fine"
StashAway,"I have been using StashAway for a while now and so far, it has been a really pleasant experience! The app is intuitive to use, navigate and comprehend. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking to invest, no matter how small the amount."

Multiple portfolios can be created to serve different needs. You can vary the risk index & see the resulting mix of ETFs in your portfolio.
StashAway,"The app is super user friendly and teaches you ways to browse around easily. Similarly, their customer service team is also efficient whenever you need further help on understanding a subject matter. So far one of the best financial platforms I‚Äôve come across."
StashAway,Great app. Loads of info. Have recommended this to a few friends already. I wish the transfer of funds from one account  to another could be done faster rather than the current 3 days.
StashAway,"Stashaway platform has allow beginners like me to invest on the go, without the fear that money will be locked up. This is why I entrust this platform to grow my money.

I love that they have fast response on WhatsApp (reduce the anxiety) and provide nuggets of finance knowledge in their app."

It allowed me to invest efficiently despite not being an experienced investor. Overall, it is easy to navigate around the app which makes the experience pleasant."
StashAway,"Getting started on investing is made easy with StashAway, the onboarding experience is sophisticated but simple. They take into account your risk appetite and personal goals, and settings can be adjusted any time. The app itself also works smoothly and is easy to view!"

StashAway,Great investment platform for beginners! Easy to use and invest without helping to actively monitor your investment! Will recommend.
StashAway,Great robo advisor investment app. User friendly interface and well managed funds!
StashAway,It‚Äôs relatively conservative investment platform for diversification. Investing in other stock is more risky but the management fees which are directly deducted from your investments can reduce the compounding effect.

StashAway,great interface
Syfe,Update to my previous review. The device pin/fingerprint login is fixed!
Syfe,"Force you to read and accept a 100 page contract just to create an account, when you just to download and have a feel of the app. Not to mention asking tons of personal information. Are you that desperate?"
Syfe,I believe Syfe should try to tap into Islamic finance where Muslim investors are looking for a place to park their cash
Syfe,I can't even start using the app. When I try to login they say that my account is deactivated
Syfe,Don't know is this app a scam app as you are not able to withdraw back your money after you do not wish to invest in this app anymore.
Syfe,Nc
Syfe,"Very poor investment return, many month still negative return, feedback to the team but still no any improvement, don't know what the investment manager doing, better go with other robo investment."
Syfe,I am from UAE I am trying to create a account but when I goes for mobile verification for Otp I don't receive any OTp in mobile no SMS come I have tried more than 20 times please assist me on this
Syfe,"There have been several updates released that have improved the UX, but the app still doesn't show the unit price during transactions, and the units displayed are only up to 2 decimal points. This makes inputing transactions on third party apps like Yahoo Finance a bit of hassle (have to do some calculations) and less accurate. Should learn from Stashaway where they show the unit price and units are displayed with 4 decimal points accuracy."
Syfe,"Rip Syfe. Hope y'all figure out a new business model, Endowus is currently leading."
Syfe,Details are not informed n clear.
Syfe,"Just joined Syfe and new to investing... but app can be improve.. 1) Forecast calculator on a permanent tab, allow user to input as many as 8 or more forecast (according to the different portolio avail) and at their own preferred amt so it would be better to allow user to add their own forecast amt and keep track of the potential growth. 2) Pending funds (like a bank app) to show money submitted and pending for approval. 3) and feedback blue users 30 days schedule call? no appt slot at all..!"
Syfe,"Unable to login with PIN as of the moment. As such, everytime I open the app, I would have to receive an SMS and an email for verification. It gets pretty annoying. Already contacted Support for this issue, but they have not been able to solve this."
Syfe,"Simple UI, frequent updates, easy and straightforward"
Syfe,"Great for beginners like me. However, would agree that negative values be indicated in red and for a way to know what's the status of our fund deposits. Overall a great app."
Syfe,easy to use interface. clean and imformative
Syfe,user friendly system and high interest as compared to Fixed Deposit
Syfe,Great app! love the interface.
Syfe,great app
Syfe,Easy to on board. Helpful n responsive
Syfe,available for all the world. and this is not usual
Syfe,it's a good app for someone who wants to invest and have no idea about stock investment.
Syfe,"There should be a feature that tells you whether the funds that you deposited is still in progress or completed (in the form of updating the users). After transferring funds, the screen of the transfer can no longer be found. There is no assurance that I have actually completed the transfer if there is nothing for me to visually confirm"
Syfe,Update: Syfe fixed their graph. They listen yaaaay! 4 stars now :) Ok pls add Time-weighted returns to your Cash+ please? The most recent update introduced a booboo where the graph always starts from 0 no matter the size of your investment. So whenever you zoom into 1 week or 1 month it's always a straight line and difficult to appreciate price movement. Hope it gets fixed SOON >:\
Syfe,nice
Syfe,"App can be further improved to show pending transaction after topup. After I clicked ""I have transferred"", there is no way to review this transaction status is under processing. Also no email acknowledgement regarding the transaction."
Syfe,"After the update, my portfolio graph became stagnant, but when I login using website, the graph is precise with the lines, however the app's graph just shows minimal difference with a straight line, please fix the matter, thank you!"
Syfe,App is good but no option to delete / hide portfolio that has been closed from being visible.
Syfe,App keeps crashing when I try to sign up.
Syfe,"Way better then picking stocks. Really passive, gives you peace of mind. I recommend their equity100 portfolio. Customer service is very good. But withdrawing and putting in funds too slow for liking"
Syfe,"Quite user friendly, I just put money in and watch it grow, I only need basic understanding of the portfolio I'm choosing and the app takes care of the rest. Definitely a more ""set it and forget it"" type of investment."
Syfe,Easy to use app! Would be even better if Syfe could show the YTD returns rather than total returns.
Syfe,"Overall, the app is good. However, the graphs/charts should be improved and user should be able to delete unwanted portfolio without having to contact support."
Syfe,"Basic portfolio views is ok but the line chart sucks.. Whether its 1W, 1M or 3M chart, it displays a flat line. Why have the chart function at all? Also, there should be an option to receive OTP via email or mobile. Finally, the portfolio returns seems so ever confusing to read. I'm not sure whether that's by design or accident."
Syfe,Great app. sound investment platform.
Syfe,"Straight forward, user friendly and substantial money maker. Syfe is definitely one of the best robo advisors in the market."
Syfe,"Having all the current values of my portfolios in green font colour (even if they're at a loss) and the font colour for everything else in white is very annoying. The colour psychology is certainly not fooling anyone. Current values should be white, profits should be green, and losses should be red like any conventional trading app. I believe Syfe takes pride in being honest but the misleading colour scheme only betrays that reputation. Otherwise, it's good to see that the app is smoother."
Syfe,"Pretty user-friendly, however I'd like to feedback that the range on the y-axis for charts is always too wide, so it basically shows a horizontal line whether it is by weekly, monthly etc, and changes in market value is practically not visible on the chart."
Syfe,"Great app. Just one minor feedback - would prefer if negative portfolio return and negative time weighted return are displayed in red, while postive portfolio return is displayed in green as this is the convention and allows for a quick snapshot of the current performance. Currently they are displayed in white, which I guess is to remove the negative connotation of a loss position. However, font colour honestly doesn't fool anyone and just makes it slightly harder to check the performance."
Syfe,"On my Razer phone, it asks me to unlock it after some idle time even if I'm not using the app. Annoying."
Syfe,"Support is pretty sub par compared to other robo advisors, and the reports which I always record for my own preference and performance is always late, and every other month there is also mistakes in the report."
Syfe,Was in a chat room with Sheryl Gasper for customer service and she stopped replying... Disappointed.
Syfe,"Easy to use, very clean design"
Syfe,"Definitely a good app to use for beginners who want to explore investments. Bearing in mind that when you invest, it's for mid term to long term."
Syfe,"Syfe support team has been very helpful and the response given is always smooth and swift. However the app itself is in need of an update. There should be a card transfer instead of bank transfer, as bank transfers are slow usually taking days to get through. Not to mention that any errors could result in losing your deposits. Overall the app itself is good, keep up the good work."
Syfe,"Syfe app has grown better and better. I can view all the transaction daily, see the up and down of portfolios. That's great. Better still, my Equity 100 has been doing well, even during the recent US Tech correction. Can't say any better. Keep up the good works...Will give 5 stars soon if can be linked to SRS and CPFIS."
Syfe,"Not so user friendly. The app sends the OTP to both email & phone, could not find any option to change this setting. Also, there is a dialog asking whether to log in with fingerprint but it will only appear AFTER user has entered the username & password on the main window. The option to log in with fingerprint should appear at the beginning when the app is launched"
Syfe,The app is running smoothly and did not encounter any problems so far. My deposit is credited to my account rather fast so that's good. Hope the returns for my portfolio will be goodüòÉ
Syfe,"It's okay if you just want to dump money and not think about it, as the UI is very minimalistic."
Syfe,Great features and easy to get started!
Syfe,I love the new informative videos and articles!
Syfe,Seen more improvement and is more stable. Can you guys include a delete button for dormant portfolios as well so we don't have to contact support to remove them manually for us.
Syfe,Current new user interface looks good. Keep improving :)
Syfe,I want to be able to rearrange the portfolio position
Syfe,Seamless n user friendly
Syfe,"On the View portfolios screen, it always scrolls past everything to the 'Referral code' section, making it impossible for me to edit, delete, or view my portfolios."
Syfe,"Chat function in app was frequently buggy, it would often crash the app. I had minor issues depositing USD and MAJOR problems withdrawing USD (unable to withdraw to digital wallets like transferwise/revolut, withdrawal in USD showed up as SGD) . My USD deposits took more days than it ought to have bc it came from a joint account and Syfe required proof that I was one of the holders. However, this requirement was not initiated by them, it was triggered AFTER I inquired on my dormant funds."
Syfe,Good app very happy with the returns so far keep it up !
Syfe,Wasted my time. Funds was deposited for 5 days and still no update for the portfolio. And the F & Q states only 1-2 days for funds to start investing. What is going on?
Syfe,Great app
Syfe,App is easy to use
Syfe,Unable to link to myinfo to verify my identity
Syfe,"Beautiful and user friendly interface. However, the app keeps stopping."
Syfe,"The recent update seems to have caused some issues. I'm not able to see the same update as the web version on the app. For example, app shows still waiting for funds while web version shows as received"
Syfe,"Add fingerprint login or auto save login information, so that we dont have to key-in all the login details everytime."
Syfe,So far so good and have invest small using their 3 main portfolios. Will observe and see the performance over the next few months.
Syfe,Easy and seamless process to start investing
Syfe,"Trying to verify my identity via MyInfo but hitting an error code -10, err_unknown_url_scheme"
Syfe,Crashed after the latest update on 8 October Error fixed. Amended my review
Syfe,App keeps crashing after update.pls fix it.
Syfe,"After the most recent update, app keeps stopping a few seconds after it is opened. Edit: issue has been resolved!"
Syfe,"Unable to verify by using SingPass, always redirect to a page and show error loading page."
Syfe,"[Returns Rate] Of the 3 robo investors i have invested for the last 6 months,Endowus, Stashaway and Syfe, Syfe is only one that has generated a loss since day 1. It has never generated any positive returns. I would never recommend SyFe to anyone."
Syfe,"I do like this app, but the past two weeks have been so painful when trying to access the app. You get it started, and it spins around and around - you can't log in, either by fingerprint or password. What's going on Syfe?"
Syfe,Your app dont let me login!
Syfe,After update having crashes on Android10 os
Syfe,Why can't log in after updating apps?
Syfe,Easy to use app but it keep crashing after the lastest update
Syfe,The new update is working now
Syfe,"Using a huawei p30pro here, after the recent update, the app just crashes after 5s. UI/UX feels smooth and sleek. Overall ok except for this bug"
Syfe,App keeps crashing after today's update
Syfe,"after the update, once I've logged in, it'll auto logged out... kindly rectify this problem..."
Syfe,New version crashes immediately after clicking into the portfolio details. Need to rollback to previous version
Syfe,Latest update kept crashing! Do not update if you have not. 3 stars to average before and after 8oct update experience
Syfe,Cannot open after update
Syfe,Tryna invest with them but it keeps crashing!
Syfe,Keep crashing on Android 10
Syfe,Great way to invest in Singapore REITs.
Syfe,"Not as user friendly, compared to the website."
Syfe,"Can't access anything - after logging in, I get stuck on a white loading screen. No issues on desktop though."
Syfe,"The app is bad, had no trouble creating an account, but myinfo constantly gave me an error page, portfolio creation was constantly giving me a white screen. I ended up having to do everything through the web. Might want to learn something from Stashaway."
Syfe,App not usable. App does not allow me to login and says wrong credential. However when keyed from desktop it allows me to login.
Syfe,"Easy to use app. But it would be very nice if we could see our portfolio summary at a glance, instead of scrolling sideways. Also, it would also be great if we could see the total amount of money invested overall, how much gain/loss etc at a glance. Also, I would like to request a feature to transfer funds in-between portfolios, so we don't have to go through the hassle of withdrawing and depositing so many times."
Syfe,Cannot edit my portfolio in the mobile app. It shows 404 error. Please fix the error asap.
Syfe,"The interface is a little weird. Nonetheless, it suits the purpose"
Syfe,I will suggest to have a feature that indicates your funds are pending like how stashaway does. It is clearer and gives me a better sense of security that my money is going to go in.
Syfe,"Pre update n post update, just can't sign in. The correct details are entered but the app keeps asking user to re_enter. Login details are just not recognized. Would give 0 stars if possible"
Syfe,"Might be good to include funding history, and status of funds transfer."
Syfe,"Unable to log in. Keep says invalid password or even when I entered, says no connections"
Syfe,Fixed bug.
Syfe,Syfe is the next influence investment through apps ...Now still have problems but I believe that Syfe can improve their technical problems every now and then ...it just need some exploration and feedback from customer to improve ....While they are focus to Singapore but try to improve the relation with another country ..
Syfe,Attempted to open a new account and shows error 404. Seems unstable.
Syfe,"Would like to suggest, 1. To have an option to toggle on/off for auto rebalancing. 2. Another account to hold the received funds, let us choose when to 'release' the fund to portfolio for purchasing of stock on that day."
Syfe,Kept hanging. Just trying to complete my portfolio took me 3 times of reloading the app.
Syfe,"The app keeps hanging during registration flow, also it does not allow me to login with message ""Invalid Email"" even though I have registered with them on their website. I have special character (+) in my email!"
Syfe,"Interesting app worth exploring, consists of two investment product for equity based and reits, app is stable, and i like the graph plot"
Syfe,Easy to use
Syfe,Great app! Outperforms every competitor
Syfe,Pretty convenient to login and browse through. Chart is a plus.
Syfe,"Syfe works like a charm. It manages my money like a pro, automatically adjusting my portfolio as market conditions change."
Endowus,Been using Endowus since Jan this year. Very user friendly and the new lower access fee for Single Fund Fund Smart is the lowest in the market currently.
Endowus,Barely any useful features compared to the web
Endowus,I have been using Endowus for the last 1 year and is happy with the support and easy to use their apps. I will recommend my relatives and friends to join Endowus and invest their CPF with them.
Endowus,"I really recommend anyone who's looking for a roboadvisor for Dollar Cost Averaging ( DCA) and passive investing to check out the Endowus platform. Been using for almost a year now and I love it. Clean UI, fast onboarding experience and easy to use. Cash from my bank account easily transferred via paynow through uob as a broker and access to core funds like S&P 500 etc. Best part of Endowus is investing your CPF. Easy and convenient. Thanks & I'll continue to invest my money through here!"
Endowus,"[Onboarding Experience] It is easy to sign up with SingPass. It took me around 10 minutes to sign up and around 3 days for my account to be ready to invest. [User Experience] The interface is easy to use and navigate. [Investment Method] Able to invest using cash, SRS and CPF OA. [Returns Rate] Rate of returns is above my expectations."
Endowus,"Easy to signup, but after signup, from verification to setting up acc with uobkh will take some time. Deposit money thru uobkh, instant but to reflect with endowus will take 2day. User can customise which funds to buy or use their auto robot porfolio to invest. If endowus can cut down the time from deposit in money to activate to buy in fund, it will be the best. The fees are kept relatively low which is key for long term investing. Definitely there room for improvement to user experience, and overall, it should be plus point for all new user, and existing user."
Endowus,This app is easy to use and useful in keeping track of my investment goals performance. Fingerprint login also makes it convenient.
Endowus,User friendly features and dashboard. The low cost and access to many funds is great. A fuss-free way to invest passively
Endowus,"Very efficient and transparently low-cost options for cash management. Able to invest both SRS, CPF and Cash accounts in the same place via . Have yet to use their FundSmart plans - but the selection is impressive."
Endowus,very easy to use even for a senior like me! Full marks!!!
Endowus,"Friendly UI, good products, able to invest SRS money at very competitive fees due to ability to access at insti level fees, while providing exposure to US markets"
Endowus,Convinent way to start investing for newbie. Sleek and user-friendly app to view portfolio in a glance.
Endowus,I have been the customer of Endowus for about 9 months and it was always been pleasant with Endowus platform which is super easy to use. Loving it and probably the best robo-advisor in town in term of returns and customer service. Long live Endowus together with me to my retirement.
Endowus,The app is easy to use. Like the way the portfolio is constructed. Allows retail investors to access Dimensional funds too!
Endowus,Its a great app. Very easy to use.
Endowus,"Excellent - easy to use, variety of investments catering to different objectives, and most importantly the returns speak for themselves."
Endowus,Just opened an account with Endowus and invested my money with them. The app is super easy to use and nagivate. Tried depositing and withdrawing money from the app and the process is seamless without any issue. Super happy and excited to come across Endowus to start my investment journey. Highly recommended !
Endowus,"App interface is simple to navigate around, and provides comprehensive overview of my current portfolio. Most importantly, it is stable and responsive."
Endowus,"Wonderful platform, easy to use and multiple options to invest and choose. I really liked the flexibility of allocating the investment according to my chosen ETFs and the best part is by investing with CPF, SRS and Cash..."
Endowus,"A great platform for Singaporeans especially Muslim Singaporeans whom would be interested in investing as Endowus do have investments in accordance to Shariah Law with CPF OA account. But sadly, I do gave feedbacks on asking them for opportunities on SA Account which they have challenges to do so. Please get it up and ready as i believe more of us would wanna get their SA invested."
Endowus,Good app . Easy to use once you are familiar to it
Endowus,"Overall great investment platform, but there's still room for further improvements Pros: - Good returns - Transparent fees - Decent amount of data displayed in app Cons: - Would love to be able to see within the app how each fund is performing - App could be better optimized (some buttons still open links in browser) - Minimum investment of $1000 and min. deposit & redemption of $100"
Endowus,Simple and intuitive design of the App makes investing easy; pretty much all can be done through the App. And the ability to invest the OA monies simply seal the deal. Have been using it since Mar '21 and the returns have been well above the CPF OA rates of 2.5/3.5%.
Endowus,"I love the intuitive user experience of the mobile app. It also implements modern security feature like biometric validation which is a huge timesaver. There are some small discrepancies between the mobile app and the web app, for example losses are displayed in red in the web app, black in the mobile app. But I am sure they will close the gap soon. Excited for the future development of Endowus. Well done üëç"
Endowus,"Endowus honestly has its clients' best interests at heart. After investing my funds in here for awhile now, returns have been really great and the services they offer keep expanding and improving everyday. Hope they keep it up!"
Endowus,Overall experience is good. Hope that I will be able to rearrange the order of each goals and please make Endowus available on Thailand's App store soon.
Endowus,User friendly interface
Endowus,User friendly. Rates on investments are better than fixed deposits
Endowus,Easy to use
Endowus,Endowus platform is user-friendly and really simple to create account with few clicks. Their support also react fast and helpful. The investment method is very simple and its written out clearly for me to read and understand with not much investment background.
Endowus,"Had really good experience with Endowus app with the ease of usage on the platform. In particular, I use the fund smart function where I'm able to pick out from a list of eligible funds. Ultimately, this fits into the low expense and high returns goal for my investment journey; allowing more transactions with no minimum purchase amount/lot as per brokerage transactions. Great! Will definitely recommend to all!"
Endowus,Clean UI and helpful customer support. Hope to continue to use!
Endowus,This app is user friendly and intuitive. Love the layout and ease of logging in using biometrics.
Endowus,"I started using Endowus in Apr 2021. What initially drawn me to it was the ability to invest my CPF monies. After using it for a few months now, I really enjoy the app and how easy it is to use. In particular, I really like the flexibility to create my own portfolio through the Fund Smart feature."
Endowus,"I have been a user of endowus for more than a year and I say that everything is smooth and it is easy to get the hang of it. The returns rate were pretty impressive for 2021, and I recently invited my wife to invest in Endowus as well. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience with Endowus as compared to the other robo advisors."
Endowus,It was very easy to sign up for an Endowus account and I used their SRS investment portfolio. The platform fee charged is very transparent and I feel is reasonable for the quality of the funds invested into. Would certainly recommend others to evaluate the offering and consider whether it is suitable for their investment objectives.
Endowus,"Probably one of the best UIs I've seen for investment apps. For those looking to invest in a robo-advisor but also want to pick and choose your own funds, Endowus has both covered."
Endowus,"Would like to suggest dark mode in the settings for mobile app if possible. Overall, the experience of using Endowus has been great. üëçüèΩ"
Endowus,"Great app, very user friendly. Even greater product to invest and grow money, with transparent fee system."
Endowus,love it
Endowus,"I like the way the app allows customization of portfolios based on the investor's risk appetites. More importantly, I find that the online seminars on Youtube to be insightful and transparent. Furthermore, they released regular quarterly reports on their fund performance, which exudes transparency."
Endowus,Fuss free client experience. Wide array of options for different needs.
Endowus,"One of the best Robo-advisors around for which I can utilise my Cash, SRS or CPF to invest. There is also a wide range of Funds, ETF portfolio and Cash Management options to choose from."
Endowus,"I have been the customer of Endowus for 7 months, and I have been loving the platform and customer experience. The fund performance has been encouraging, app is user friendly, and customer service is also prompt. Give it a try, I highly recommend it!"
Endowus,It had been a great 7 months since I start using Endowus platform for investment using my SRS after my wife show me an article in NSmen magazine on Roboinvest. As an investment novice the experience has been great and the customer service is very prompt in answering my queries. The mobile app has been very handy either for checking the return or initiating a new investment. The app and webpage are well designed and a definitely good place to start investing for beginners. Enjoy the webinar hosted by Endowus and gain a lot of insights.
Endowus,"The mobile app is still WIP but pretty good! For full features, it will direct you to the website. Am a happy customer of Endowus."
Endowus,CPF-OA investments.. Just Amazing
Endowus,Very user-friendly apps. I like the dashboard that provides a clear glance of my investment portfolio. Other features like Model Asset Allocation gives me a better decision to select the suitable investment model for myself. Activity & Reward give the clear transaction details. Thanks to have this mobile apps!
Endowus,"Easy onboarding via MyInfo, the only adviser to allow use of CPF for investments. Amazing customer support. Please consider dark mode for app! üòä"
Endowus,I installed the app recently and find it easy to navigate. I particularly like the dashboards that provide an overall view of our investments. I also found the toggling of the simulation of returns helpful before we decide on what to invest in. I would encourage users to attend the webinars conducted by Endowus - they are educational with data being shared and explained in simple ways for an investor to understand.
Endowus,Easy to use UI w straightforward instructions to follow to deposit money etc.
Endowus,"The platform is easy to use, onboarding experience is handled well. I also agreed with the Investment Stratge used and I believe the return will be wonderful."
Endowus,One if the most comprehensive yet simple to use robo advisor platform/app used. Transfer of funds and investing is informative and fuss free. Replies/support advises my email inquiries was also prompt and quick.
Endowus,"Simple, easy to use for passive investors like me."
Endowus,"Always preferred financial providers with digital solutions. From the start of account opening to actual account usages, Endowus has been pretty impressive and the interface is clean and intuitive; no tutorial is needed to navigate the site. The apps is a breeze to use as well, showing the most essential information that I need to see regarding my investments. Highly recommended, keep up the good work Endowus team."
Endowus,"Beautiful & easy to use platform. Best robo advisor that allows us to invest our cash, CPF & SRS into high quality funds with flexibility at the lowest cost. Achieved more than double digit growth % in my portfolio within 6 months & my portfolio continues to grow under Endowus. Double thumbs up for Endowus! Keep up the good work!"
Endowus,"Easy to use and good returns, recommended it to my dad"
Endowus,Decent app for a robo advisor. Have been using for a few months now and the UI experience has been pretty enjoyable! Able to see my portfolio performance at a glance.
Endowus,"Have been using endowus since start of 2021, it's been really easy to use, and i like that it is licensed by MAS, and are held through uob kayhian, which gives me greater peace of mind that they are a serious and trustworthy platform"
Endowus,easy to use and i receive regular updates on the investments.
Endowus,I like the fact that SRS could be tapped under this robo advisor. The navigation is easy. Had initial trouble when signing up but it was my own clumsiness. Their client support is very patient to help me sort things out. It was a breeze in my subsequent adjustment to my portfolio.
Endowus,[Returns Rate] although its only been more than a month the returns are really surpassing my expectations. [Onboarding Experience] the sign process is very fast. Its so easy to sign up I've been recommending it to most of my friends. I'd especially recommend it to less investment minded people [User Experience] I've used stashaway for a long time and I think Endowus is going to give them a good run for their money.
Endowus,"Onboarding process is very smooth in overall, for me I am using the Cash Smart and everything is very straight forward. Keep in mind that there are few days of processing time in both deposit or withdrawal."
Endowus,I have used Endowus to park my excess cash to earn higher than bank deposit rate. The platform is easy to use and navigate.
Endowus,"Currently the only platform that allows CPF-OA monies investment for robo. Taking advantage of the bullish market to boost returns compared to the floor rates given by CPF. Onboarding is straight-forward, reasonable fees compared to UT and multiple information such as projection, annualized rate of return with composition of funds shown clearly. 5 stars!"
Endowus,The investment appears fine but the system isn't the most intuitive (not that straightforward to use) and the data tends to have some lag (a week after my investment it still shows as pending in the app).
Endowus,easy and handing app to monitor my portfolios and for transactions.
Endowus,Easy sign up and funding. Transfers between accounts may take awhile. Total amount reflection when transfering inbetween portfolios might not be accurate during period of transfer.
Endowus,Good robo investment platform. Easy to use and fast support response.
Endowus,Only one which offer access to SPY500 using CPF and SRS at low fees
Endowus,"Endowus enables us to invest in the S&P 500 index using cash, SRS and CPF OA. It is hassle free and allows us to make money fuss free"
Endowus,"Originally signed up to get access to Dimensional funds for my SRS. So far getting the best returns out of my other SRS related investments. Email notifications might be a bit too much, but maybe necessary (i.e. upcoming investment, cash/srs received, investment complete), I'm now considering to add more cash related portfolios as well. Very helpful and responsive customer support!"
Endowus,On boarding was smooth via my Info and overall a great user experience
Endowus,I love that endowus mobile app allows me to check my investment portfolios on the go. I appreciate the easy and simple user interface.
Endowus,"Super easy to use app! Shows me the returns of my total portfolio and my sub portfolios all at a glance on home page, without having to navigate across multiple pages! Good if you can implement the top company and market holdings, at a total portfolio level, similar to the web version."
Endowus,"User-friendly, transparent and efficient. Always evolving too - I really like the latest sustainability/ESG and customizable portfolios. Looking forward to more initiatives and even more returns (: 23Oct2020: Sleek and smooth interface, interactive graphs are very useful. Thanks for bringing Endowus to mobile (:"
Endowus,"App interface is good and easy to understand. It provides me the summary of my portfolio clearly. On top of that, very satisfied with the performance. Thank you Endowus!"
Endowus,I've invested using Endowus for more than a year. They are prompt in answering my queries. Good job.
Endowus,"Takes 2-3 days for money to appear in, then takes a few days for it to be invested in the portfolio. Not a great choice if you're in a rush, but this offers CPF OA investments compared to the other robos. Also lacks security like 2FA which is concerning. Hope to see dark mode too."
Endowus,"First impression - not too impressive. Deposited the fund 6+ in the morning today, not updated after 12 hours. Whereas with Stashaway and Syfe, fund deposit always updated around half working day thus far."
Endowus,Super easy to use.
Endowus,w3
Endowus,"Best roboadvisor easily. Really simple interface, low fees and widest range of offering."
Endowus,Smooth and clean but auto logging out the app is not the only way to ensure security. It just caused inconvenience and frustration. Please explore more.
Endowus,"Smooth interface, easy to navigate between investment goals"
Endowus,Best platform to tap and invest your pool of unused CPF OA funds for better returns. Intuitive interface. You can choose to DIY your own portfolio with Fund Smart using your cash/CPF/SRS funds. This is a fantastic tool to achieve your investment objectives better. Also one of my favourite roboadvisors out there overall as the fees are kept relatively low which is key for long term investing.
Endowus,Easy account opening .
Endowus,Easy to use and clean interface to monitor the returns.
Endowus,Probably my favourite robo-adviser.
Endowus,"Easy to use interface, nice aesthetics and most importantly works as needed to. And of course the fee rebates makes its even better."
Endowus,"Setting up an account with Endowus was pretty easy and straight forward. The app is easy to navigate around such as making deposit, checking my portfolio and setting the type of invest I want to make. Highly recommended! (:"
Endowus,"The setting up of account was easy and fuss-free. The entire process took less than a week before I could start to deposit and invest. The mobile application is very easy to use and navigate. Endowus is also very upfront with their management fees at the beginning, which is something I really appreciate. One feature I would hope to see in future is the option to make recurring weekly transfers (currently only monthly transfers option available). Overall, I think that Endowus is a good robo-advisor all working adults/professionals can consider for their investment purposes."
Endowus,Great experience using both the online web and mobile platforms. Easy to understand and navigate. Great support given by the team where they provide timely support and updates in terms of any help needed in fund transfer or portfolio rebalancing. Fruitful engagement to Endowus users with weekly webinars.
Endowus,"I really like using endowus. It has many different portfolio to choose from. I can invest cash, SRS and CPF all in 1 platform. The app has a clean interface and it is easy to use for investing."
Endowus,User friendly app. Most functions easily accessible and clear display of all information. No real problems using except once in a while a little slow to refresh.
Endowus,"[Onboarding Experience] simple and fast, [Customer Support] email queries were replied promptly [Waiting Time] quick [User Experience] easy to use, esp with recurring investments"
Endowus,App is simple and easy to navigate around it.
Endowus,"Easy to use, seamless UI. I really like how easy they have made investing. Really helped me overcome that inertia to start it all."
Endowus,"Excellent products offered. No nonsense platform with great customer service. Low fees, SRS investment eligibility."
Endowus,Great product and great app. Easy to use for fuss free investment. Clear interface to monitor performance of the funds.
Endowus,awesome
Endowus,"I had been a happy EndowUS customer before the app was launched, now I am even happier. The app design is sleek, the dashboard provide all necessary information at a glance. My investment journey with them is even better, low cost investment is what I strongly believe in, and thank you for bringing it to us."
Endowus,"My first roboadvisor. Currently using for Cash and SRS. I compared Endowus to the other robos available and the main advantage that I chose this over others is that the funds bought will be under your name. In addition, there are also a range of relatively low expense unit trusts to choose from. Another competitive advantage of Endowus is the trailer fee rebate. App is intuitive and easy to use. It will be good to have the fees charged for each portfolio reflected somewhere.."

Endowus,Easy to nagivate the app and information is well displayed in the home page
Endowus,Great app with user friendly interface
Endowus,App is user friendly and on boarding process is quick. Recommended for making fuss free investments.
Endowus,Great UI/UX and auto deduction for CPF option
Endowus,I chose to invest in Endowus because they have a great philosophy and reason behind all that they are doing. Which is to level the playing field for retail investors like myself with the many large institutional players out there. The main upside for endowus is that they are not conflicted when it comes to recommending the different funds to you! Definitely worth trying them out to believe! Good things must share!
Endowus,"been using endowus for few months and very satisfied with overall experience. customer service has been very prompt. currently am using their cash smart, returns so far has been positive!"
Endowus,Easy and fast set up
Endowus,Definitely a must have for the app to view all your investments and details
Endowus,Endowus platform is user-friendly and easy to use. Their team is also very professional and efficient. I'm happy with what I have experienced with Endowus.
Endowus,"Good robo investor but can't really put a comprehensive review here but here's a summary: Excellent customer service, beautiful app, ok investment returns (only been using for less than half a year, unit trusts investing using your own custodian account while other robots have co-mingled (each pros and cons)"
Endowus,"Good app, easy to use and understand. Though the onboarding and initial phase take quite some time to process."
Endowus,"Great app, easy to use and steady returns!"
Endowus,"great service - manage my entire CPF OA balance above 20,000 at endowus and also have some cash goals set up for child's education and my wife and i's retirement. appreciate how they are very transparent for each fund how much is the trailer fee being rebated and therefore serves as an additional return to you. i am not aware of any other platform that practices this brutal transparency which is great for the consumer."
Endowus,App is easy to use. Similar to website. Wished it was faster to reallocate funds between goals. Also prefer the graph to shows gains over time rather than raw investment value.
Endowus,Glad to see improvement gradually being rolled out!
Endowus,"Processing time for everything (account opening, investing) takes too long. I worry about having to withdraw my money when the time comes."
Endowus,"Nice app, investment return is so good"
Endowus,"Amazing app, very easy to use and fast loading"
Endowus,"Compared to Stashaway, it's a very lengthy signup process for an account before you can view anything"
Endowus,App looks great and gives a good amount of information that you'd be looking for upfront. Only complaint is how often it kicks you into a web page view
Endowus,"Endowus support team has been very helpful and the response given is always smooth and swift. However the app itself is in need of an update. There should be a card transfer instead of bank transfer, as bank transfers are slow usually taking days to get through. Not to mention that any errors could result in losing your deposits. Overall the app itself is good, keep up the good work."
Endowus,"Very clean app with neat UI. Instructions were clear and everything was very transparent. Great for beginners, would definitely recommend."
Endowus,A seamless investment experience
Endowus,Is there a bug with the biometric login option? Cannot select this option in my S7. Edit: Biometric login problem has been solved after feedback to the team. Thanks!
Endowus,"Unable to log in through the app, no problems via website"
Endowus,"Tried 15 mins, cant download app. Disappointing. Using andriod."
Endowus,Great sign up flow
Endowus,Love the app! Nice clean interface and easy to use
Endowus,onboarding is too complicated and lengthy. i cant even begin to see what is offered in the app without giving all my personal details and accepting every term and condition
Endowus,"For OA investment , the processing very slow. Signed up for an account about 3-4weeks ago and OA investment is still processing. Signing up of CPFIA is a slow process, nothing like advertised. For new CPFIA, the user has to go UOB outlet. It will take about close to 2weeks for CPFIA account to be ready. Fund is still in processing after linking CPFIA for 4days. Will not recommend endowus. I've been on stashaway, and their UI is superb. Too bad they do not have CPF option."
Endowus,Sleek & intuitive app which gives u an overview of all your investments at the homescreen.
Endowus,Very pleased to experience endowus on a mobile app! Just a small request is to have a dark mode on the app in future updates.
Endowus,"Finally mobile app is available, cant figure out how to enable biometric login"
Endowus,I love Endowus!
Endowus,Finally!!! Nice and clean! Stay invested!
Endowus,"Finally, I can manage my Endowus portfolios wherever I go. Sleek and informative UI. Easy to navigate."
StashAway,"out of 5 times, the app wouldn't start for 4 times. crashes my phone after i open it too. xiao mi mix 2. please optimize it. it's not usable"
StashAway,Very intuitive interface and lots of useful educational material.
StashAway,"The investments seem promising. But as this is a new service, only time will tell if it‚Äôs truly reliable. The UI is quite good and it‚Äôs easy to navigate and easy on the eyes."
StashAway,"THIS APP DONT DESERVE 5 STARS , BUT DESERVE MORE THAN 5 STARS. THE SECURITY IS STABLE. ME AND MY TEAM TRIED TO DECOMPILE THE APP AND PENTEST ... EVERYTHING IS OBSFUCATED AND ENCRYPTED. NICE JOB ! VERY SECURE. KEEP IT UP"
StashAway,Amazing app to plan for the future.
StashAway,Easy to use and progress is the investment are shown in a clean and clear way.
StashAway,"App is easy to use, all the information you need is accessible from the app. Client team is helpful, they have a whastapp function, and the educational articles are generally informative. The returns are good so far!"
StashAway,"If you are new to investing and want more customisation than roboadvisors from banks like DBS, you can try Stashaway. They have different risk index from 10 to 36 per cent while DBS has 4 or 5 options. Overall, quite pleased with their transparency and customer service Do know what you are getting into."
StashAway,Amazing user experience that greatly simplify investment!
StashAway,"The app is very easy to use for anything you want to do with your account from investing or checking your profile to reading about tips to help the newbie investor. Occasionally, the app spazzes up on me and I have to exit and reopen the app but it doesnt happen that often so it‚Äôs ok, i think. Because of its nature, it can be a bit disheartening to watch a drop in the portfolio, especially as you have little to no control, but if you‚Äôre looking into this long term, just focus on long term returns, it should be good. The deposit plan allows me to easily put in money every month automatically."
StashAway,"USER EXPERIENCE: I've been a stashaway user for almost 2 years. From my point view, I can summarize my experience in the following points: - Quite transparent in what my funds will be allocated to. - At times there will be re-optimizations of your portfolio to keep up with the current market's trend. - Returns so far for my account, from the day I started invested has a Money Weighted Return of 11% (As of 1 Sep 2021). In my opinion, it's quite a progress. - Ease of investment and suitable for people who want to start investing but don't know where to start. Treat it as a stepping stone to start investing before investing yourself independently. - Has articles that describe their planned movements. Quite transparent on what they want to do of our funds. - Verified by Securities Commission of Malaysia. That's mostly what I can talk about it. Overall it's a good app for you to start considering investing in US Markets."
StashAway,"At the beggining, I was not very have faith in this platform so I start with small amount of money. Then, after 1 year I am still here which they are reliable and growing. If you are inexperience and no time to invest in stock marketÔºåstashaway is one of the good choice. Simple user interfaceÔºåporgressly updating the investing strategy to optimize return and reduce risk, low management fee and free article that educate you about money monthly! If you want to try, you may use my referral link (stashaway.my/erferrals/tienpeysrma) to waive 6 months management fee."
StashAway,"Love the app, it's been working flawlessly since my inception onto the service! Really loving the optimization aspect of Stashaway too."
StashAway,Great app for investing
StashAway,low performance
StashAway,Stash away good but how to invest faster
StashAway,Wave pay
StashAway,"Overall look and feel is VERY good. COmPrehEnSIve. My issue atm is why re-optimize to a questionable stock? ChinaTech is down and like all over the news about it. I am curious as to why the decisioning. I miss my old portfolio, coz at least I was getting 'something'. Also, what's the point of a chart that projects beyond 10 years with a variety of portfolio updates along the way later? It doesn't make sense to informational consistency; to me, at least."
StashAway,Poor performance. Moving away to other roboadvisors
StashAway,Stupid apps
StashAway,StashAway is way too good too be just in traditional stock exchange. Should consider going into crypto exchange. Create own coin. Blockchain. Provides a crypto wallet for traders to store their electronic funds. The exchange also should supporting services for users to store digital currencies. Good luck.
StashAway,Hii may i know if u could invest money for free? Or u'll need some money to start off? Pls do reply me! Thanks!
StashAway,"I've been with Stashaway since 2018. I love that Stashaway is extremely user-friendly and most importantly, it truly delivers, be it the promised withdrawal times or keeping me updated about the funds received, or about portfolio reallocation, etc... I feel that the people running it are also knowledgable, communicative, and approachable without ever being pushy, which I really appreciate. I think I can count on Stashaway for my retirement in 20+ years', so I'm with Stashaway for the long run!"
StashAway,Can't open the app.
StashAway,"A great platform to invest on ETFs, especially for beginners who wants to have a peace of mind."
StashAway,"Overall, app is easy to understand/use. However, lacklustre performance in stashaway portfolio. Invested in 6 months, literally the returns (-1%) is disappointing. Even when there is slight growth, it's bound to go back down to negative territory. No signs of hope in growth"
StashAway,Stashaway interface and returns are negatively correlated. App has a great interface!
StashAway,Desible
StashAway,This app is scam thief I hate the app üò°üò°üò°üò°
StashAway,Simple way to robo invest. I'm still trying to figure out how the reoptimisation works because it kinda reduced my earnings so far
StashAway,"Stashaway interface is seamless and easy to understand. So based on this I give full star However just a note that the fingerprint authorization takes some time to respond, and at the same time does not react to my touch. I have to click out and the click in the second time for it to work. But might just be my phone."
StashAway,Very prompt service. Had trouble opening my account but was guided very well by the management. Thank you.
StashAway,Before this I had a deposit. But I haven't opened it in a long time. When I reopen I have to re -register my account and my money is gone. 5/8/2021
StashAway,For those inexperience and no time to invest in stock marketÔºåstashaway is one of the good choice. Simple user interfaceÔºåporgressly updating the investing strategy to optimize return and reduce risk Ôºåand most importantly low management fee and free of charge for dollar cost averaging. You can even choose to dollar cost average per day without extra chargeÔºÅ
StashAway,For idk what reasons!!!...All my investment performance portfolio dropping like china tech stocks. Stashaway need to do something as other robots are performing better... really disappointed
StashAway,Scammer app .I put it as the lowest risk and invested 2k .lost 200 in a month .this app is out to scam ur money away don't download it

StashAway,The app is very easy to navigate! The layout is straightforward and there are no hiccups so far.
StashAway,"If you're a beginner investor just starting out or just want a fuss free experience to invest and earn a decent return with low fees, I would highly suggest using stashaway!"

StashAway,This apps assist you in investing by just a few clicks. It is very informative and strongly recommended for people who are new in investment.
StashAway,The user interface is simple and effective making the experience of using the app pleasant. Their customer service is also stellar. This is an easy to use app for those who are beginners to investing.
StashAway,Been using Stashaway for more than 3 years. Like the neat UI and concept of it. Returns have been satisfactory. Would definitely adding more fund into it.
StashAway,A simple investing app. Overall easy to use and just a great with guide on how to invest and advices.
StashAway,"User friendly platform, simple to use and effective. Highly recommended!"
StashAway,Easy to use and intuitive.
StashAway,Changing of funds to something that's lousier than before caused me to lose more money than I have already gained. Do NOT change to funds that get politically impacted.
StashAway,Ÿ§Ÿ£
StashAway,Nice and easy to use. Would like to see how different recurring investments can affect the projections. Addition of non phone number 2FA would be nice.
StashAway,Moonzia

StashAway,"Had invested 4 months and glad to see it's growth steadly in bear market. To be honest, i was worried when i see the negative figure in the first two months and finally it becomes positive even in this bad market time!"
StashAway,Simple app that shows you what matters
StashAway,"It has been a great start so far with StashAway. You just need to stash away the money you would like to invest with them, and leave them to do the rest. There is bound to be ups and downs or the market at times, but they determine and evaluate your risk appetite beforehand so you should be able to stomach it. Their education material available in the app is also helpful to read up, usually every week or two should have a new article for you to read up to build up the financial literacy knowledge in yourself. It's free some more! Their client engagement team is also very responsive and efficient, which is a plus point because of good customer service. All in all, worth it for beginners to give it a try!"

StashAway,"Reliable investing app with emphasis on long term. Also the Stashaway academy teaches you the basics of a safe long term investing. (If you are looking for any crazy returns and get rich quick schemes, this app won't be for you.)"
StashAway,"Ever since I started investing with StashAway, I've grown more confident each day knowing that my money is working for me while I sleep at night. It provides such simplicity and convenience especially for those beginning in their investment journey. I will definitely recommend this as the investment app to use for any beginners."

It's totally not complicated at all, not just for saving, Stashaway help you invest your money that will also benefit you for a long run. This is a great tool that allows you to invest especially when you are tight on time and dont have the capacity to research everything about the stock market. This is not for traders but for the long term"
StashAway,The app is user-friendly as I did not need to spend a lot of time at the start in learning how to use it. Customer service via Whatsapp is super efficient and helpful. Portfolio returns are acceptable given my lower risk index. Definitely recommending this to my friends.
StashAway,Not satisfy during my first experience with StashAway as the user journey is quite complicated and tend to make a mistake. Have suffered a loss immediately in the first day of investment.
StashAway,Been using it for quite a few months. Overall good & satisfied. Hope for more features to be added
StashAway,Exactly what I needed to manage my personal finance. I am someone who lack of time to manage each individual portfolio. This basically automates the portfolio based on risk level. Thank you.
StashAway,New to Stashaway and the app lives up to its reputation; a clean user interface and intuitive navigation. I get regular updates and tips on investigating too. üëç
StashAway,"Easy to use, fuss free platform. Good for those new to investing. Let them do the work!"
StashAway,Nice Saving Apps
StashAway,Excellent!
StashAway,Easy to use and very little time spent to set up a monthly plan
StashAway,This app is very well made and I feel very comfortable and secure using it. It has a great design and explains every step of the process easily. I was recommended this app by a family and I am grateful that I was introduced it as it was more helpful than I thought
StashAway,User friendly and easy to set up account
StashAway,"The interface is easy to use especially for new investors like me. The educational material is easy to understand, succinct and perfect for reading on the go while travelling :) Returns wise, have been on the app for 7 months and it has only started coming in during the past 2 weeks."
StashAway,"Favourite Robo-Investor I'm happy that StashAway leaves a peace of mind when it comes to automated investing. Although the algorithm of purchasing and selling can improve, I still say the overall is still above par. Customer support could improve too (solutions often happens after escalations) StashAway platform has sufficient educational materials to share about the existing economic situations they perceive and what's the next best move to make. I learned the acronym DCA from StashAway!!!"
StashAway,"I've been using StashAway for a year. I've used both the Apple Store and Google Play Store apps. The apps work reliably. Withdrawals and deposits work in a straightforward manner, and any issues I've had have been promptly addressed by customer service (reachable on WhatsApp - genius). Investing comes with risks. This is not financial advice, do your own research. But I will say, I can sleep happily on these investments."
StashAway,I think the app is great (clean user interface and no glitches thus far). I have invested for about half a year and returns are growing.
StashAway,The interface is really userfriendly and I love how amateur investors who have no clue on investing can very easily get started with stashaway.
StashAway,Very easy to use and invest.
StashAway,Easy and simple way to invest my money ! üòõüòõüòõ

StashAway,"- Fuss free sign-up with info retrieval from singpass - clean and user-friendly interface - hands off approach investing with minimal effort required, just have to include a few inputs and they'll recommend you plans"
StashAway,"A very intuitive and easy to use app. The webinars and information given by the team to investors are very helpful, giving me the confidence to leave my funds with them. The management fees, however, are on the higher end, but I guess this is to be expected given their reputation as a 'Robo Investor'. It is possible to enjoy certain promotions to have your money managed for free."
StashAway,"Have been using this apps for more than 3 months, overall experience is great. Recommend for youngsters to try out this apps as it helps to accumulate your money by passively investing it into the market. Getting a return more than bank interest in this 3 months time. 1. Investment performance was good. 2, Apps was simple and user friendly 3. The charges was low 4. Provides free continuous education and articles to read"

StashAway,- It requires the feasibility to deposit cents into Stashaway account as the current deposit feature do not permit cents to be deposited into account.

StashAway,Today is 18 June 2021 Why I still can't run the app even I have updated it?
StashAway,"I started using it 3 years ago for passive investment. Since then they have added almost 0 features. No, graphs, dashboard to better show your investments. I do not think they are a fast growing startup anymore. Not even generating good returns for account holders. Time to get money out of it slowly and put in better place."

StashAway,easy to use
StashAway,Very very user friendly app! Definitely easy to understand and use even for a beginner.

StashAway,"As i opened the app today, it reminds me to update the app but mine was already updated and still keep remind me to update"
StashAway,Simple will no longer be shariah compliant. That sucks for Muslim investors. Have to withdraw all my money.

StashAway,Great app user friendly

StashAway,"This app gives me problem when it comes to updating.When I opened the apps, it says it's time to update. When I press the update button it brings me to Google playstore but the apps does not show any update..when I press the ""open"" button, it reverts to the previous screen telling me to update the apps. That's not supposed to be the case. Can you do something about it?"

StashAway,Easy to use and good for investing passively
StashAway,"The app itself is good as it is not cluttered and I find it easy to navigate and get the info I need. The customer support is also very responsive as they reply within 24 hours of sending an email.

Registration and first deposit will take a longer time (about 1 week for me) but the subsequent deposits, including the buy order will be completed in 2-3 working days. App is very user friendly to use and there are multiple resources available i.e. articles/podcasts/webinars if you're keen to learn more about investing. Customer service is responsive and helpful too :)"
StashAway,Hello stashaway. I made multiple small deposits into my account and they weren't reflected in my portfolio for days.
StashAway,"So far one of the apps that are working properly without any glitches compared to others. User interface is superb, easy to navigate and user-friendly. Would recommend this to those looking for passive investing."
StashAway,Stashaway is really the go to robo-advisor for investment newbies that do not want the hassle of managing their investment. Awesome features and has great transparency with their fees. Highly recommended if you plan to invest your money and never have to manage it again.
StashAway,"The app user interface is nice and attractive where it make users easy to navigate and search the information easily. Furthermore, the app also focusing on investment education where it provide a good learning opportunity for a newbie to learn on financial management!"
StashAway,I regret using this service. I made an investment decision on 19th May and submitted my order. Funds got deducted from my bank account on 24th May. They are still not reflecting in my StashAway portfolio. Today on 26th May notification says it will be processed in 2 to 3 working days. So if your lifespan is 300 years go with this slow service. However if you are a mortal being with much lesser life span then better stay away from them.
StashAway,"The app has been great, and with super simple interface to keep track and manage my finances on the go! Stashaway Academy is also well designed and delivered in a simple, and easy to understand manner."
StashAway,Not sure why. I often get black screen when opening this app.
StashAway,"Good app. Allows better tracking of deposits through to investment of the funds. But as it currently does not offer Shariah compliant / Islamic friendly portfolios, I will be moving my money off the platform"
StashAway,"Very good, keep it up."
StashAway,Pretty poor
StashAway,The verification process took me more than 1 week and I am yet able to open my account. The procedure even slower than the trandiotnal banks. So much hassle.
StashAway,Hopefully will get Chinese version soon.
StashAway,Very happy with the experience of using Stashaway. Their customer care is very nice and does solve your problem effectively in a short time.
StashAway,"Stashaway's academy has really been a great help to my savings and investing journey, and the user interface is simple and easy to understand, with different risk levels available. The great thing is you can create multiple portfolios for you different goals, and that's a great experience! üëç"

StashAway,‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶∞ ·óí·ó©·óï
StashAway,I've been using for a while. Only issue I faced lately is that I cannot do a manual one-time deposit. I'm using Maybank and my transfer failed because apparently Stashaway's bank account number is invalid?
StashAway,"Great app! Constantly updated and still runs on my old phones and Huawei. User interface is nice and simple. Easy to navigate and manage portfolios. Performance of investments are really easy to track. The security is exceptional, even better than some banking apps.

Totally recommended for new and seasoned investors."
StashAway,Nice app
StashAway,"Easy, user-friendly & straightforward investing app!"
StashAway,"Really enjoyed using the app so far, very user friendly. And the support team (on WhatsApp and email) is patient and quick to respond to any of my queries, average response time in less than few hours. Would recommend Stashaway for a more passive investing approach."
StashAway,"User-friendly robo advisor for first time investor. Other than the investment portfolio, features like StashAway Simple money market fund and StashAway Academy tutorials are also value-added for the first time investor."
StashAway,Useless lose money all the way
StashAway,Can WP for investing save?
StashAway,I can't get through step 5.. I deposit money but it won't show up on my profile..
StashAway,Stupid
StashAway,Old time
StashAway,"Definitely one of the more user friendly UIs out there. Without prior experience or academic learning, it 'limits' the amount of risk you are allowed to take. I am one of those, thus I have a very stable portfolio. Would definitely recommend especially to the newest of people who are afraid of starting investing."
StashAway,Why is it taking so long to load the app after updating? It's taking more than 10 sec to go to pin number page. Used to be faster before the updates.
StashAway,Good job
StashAway,"Friendly interface , knowledgeable academy section with articles, education material and podcasts."
StashAway,Its very convenient and good for the investor to place their money in stashaway. The platform is easy to use as it shows the risk profile that u may undertake when investing.

StashAway,"App forces user to setup device screen lock. Existing pin works fine already. Setup Screen Lock button wrongly navigates to app settings screen instead of screenlock setup screen. Poor design decision. Edit: a month later, still insist on user having a lock screen to use the app. Removed Setup Screen Lock button instead of fixing it"
StashAway,took 5-day to see my first deposit reflected in account. instantly losing 0.26% on day-0.

StashAway,Black screen when opening the apps. After a while then only can access the account. Please fix it as soon as possible.
StashAway,"Easy to use user interface, straightforward and upfront with their diversification strategies. Will definitely recommend for investors who prefer a relatively hands-off fuss-free approach."
StashAway,They can use your content for all their existing and future services
StashAway,I have been using StashAway since 2018. Money-weighted returns are at 11.86% so far with a 18% risk index. The experience has been great so far and I honestly have nothing to complain about. I've set up a standing order to DCA monthly.
StashAway,One of the worst app of investment. Its taking almost 20 days to deposit funds and its still not procee. Dont fool the custermer to say just 15 min to start investment. 0 star ratting.
StashAway,"Love the user interface of the Stashaway app, its super intuitive and easy to use. My returns through investing with Stashaway since December last year has been really solid as well!"
StashAway,Rates us

StashAway,"Best ever, but one question , can one person have both the accounts in Malaysia and Singapore...."
StashAway,Stupid app
StashAway,"Stashaway support team has been very helpful and the response given is always smooth and swift. However the app itself is in need of an update. There should be a card transfer instead of bank transfer, as bank transfers are slow usually taking days to get through. Not to mention that any errors could result in losing your deposits. Overall the app itself is good, keep up the good work."

StashAway,Nifty little robo-investor to help squirrel savings away + generate some passive income!! Super easy to use and so satisfying to see savings grow over time.

StashAway,Stashaway was the first roboadvisor I joined in Nov 2017 and I have had a good experience with it so far. The app is easy to use and the information is clear; I think it has one of the best UI and UX out of all the roboadvisors I'm using. I have been DCA-ing and deposits are generally processed prompty. I am happy with my returns so far as well!
StashAway,I have been using StashAway for the past 1 year and I am glad to say the decision to start my investment journey in this wealth management platform has been a good one. The platform interface and user experience on both the desktop and mobile are equally great. The assets in all my investment portfolios are clearly listed out along with their weightage and value. Transferring money into the platform is easy.
StashAway,"I have one main issue with app or website. After setup a goal based portfolio, it's very difficult to find out what was the set goal. I don't understand why it's so hard to make the goal visible. I've feedback this several times and doesn't seem like Stashaway will do anything about it."
StashAway,User friendly and clear information on your investment. Easy for beginner investor like me.
StashAway,Quick and easy
StashAway,"Have been using Stashaway since 2019. Created multiple portfolios for different goals. So far returns have been promising. I think UI can be improved- by showing Net Deposit on top of Current Value at the Performance page. Other than that, nothing to complain about the experience."

StashAway,"Started my Stashaway journey with a low 16% risk portfolio on Nov 2019 and was DCA a couple hundreds every month. Then COVID came and my investment began to turn into losses. Thank goodness I stuck with my investment every month had increased the risk factor during the initial market crash. Now my portfolio is looking better than before! Stashaway is also quite prompt with money withdrawals and money receipt acknowledgements, and will generally invest your money within 2 biz days (1 for conversion to USD, 1 for buying the stocks). I have tried out other robo-advisor platforms and none have come close to the efficiency of their App, acknowledgement emails, customer response duration, speed of investment, and of course most importantly, the returns:))))"

StashAway,"Easy to use and fuss free, with graphs it is clear to investors on potential growth of the invested amount"
StashAway,A user friendly app that helps you to invest when you are still a noob in the investment line.

StashAway,"Verify take whole week, top up also take whole week. Very dissatisfied and disappointed."
StashAway,The customer experience sucks. You ask them to do one thing about your personal information clearly and they still don't do it right after requesting it multiple times and through different channels.
StashAway,"I had been started since Sept 2019, the return has been promising!!! The GUI keeps improving, support from the team has been great too!! I had been kept recommending to my friends all these while!!! Keep up the great work!!"

StashAway,Minus one star just because I can't giro monthly and need manual transfer
StashAway,"Love that StashAway provides podcast and academy for the public to educate them more on financing and investment.

Even if you don't use StashAway (which I recommend you do use it), the information you learn from them will make you tad wiser in your personal finance management."
StashAway,"The mobile app is clean and functional, easy to navigate, and responsive. (edited 2021-02-18) a response and a fix for my issue from the devs in 1 day, now that's great service. Keep it up folks. I've edited this review to remove my problem description."
StashAway,Romantic
StashAway,Please add a mode for muslims. Edit: A lot of websites and blogs pointed out that StasAway isn't shariah compliant.
StashAway,Been using it for a couple of months and the experience so far has been great! Customer service is quick to respond and the deposits I made are quick to appear!
StashAway,"Great platform for beginner investor. The UI is easy to understand and navigate. A wise recommendation would be go for long term, continue DCA and enjoy the wave."
StashAway,"One of the best investing platform, I like the transparency this app offers which makes me feel safe and secure about my money! Thanks StashAway, keep it up"
StashAway,"It is not like stocks that require in-depth research on what you invest in. I only need to choose my risk preferences, and then everything is handed over to their AI to make investment decisions, which can avoid my bias and human errors. If anyone are not familiar with stocks, you can start here. Also return rate is better and higher than other platform. Love it so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
StashAway,"Great apps! User friendly, strongly recommended people to try it"
StashAway,Great UI and easy to manage.
StashAway,"I glad to be part of SA family, it seem promising than other platforms that I have try before..

Please make way for using debit or credit card in the future.. Please...."
StashAway,"very dummy friendly,, support is great and surprisingly open to any questions. very cool."
StashAway,Is it Shariah-compliant? for muslim investors
StashAway,"Best robo-advisor app so far. Makes investing in various assets around the world easy, straightforward and cheap. The returns are pretty good too. Should have come across this app sooner before I had turned to Unit Trusts, now I think I'll divert some extra cash here instead EDIT: one small thing I wish is the ability to make multiple SA Simple Acc. Some funds I prefer to segregate when in the MM fund, but otherwise, great app."
StashAway,"Simple & functional UI. Transparent statements and helpful support team. Everything you need in an app. Most importantly, GOOD rates!"
StashAway,"Has been great so far. The interface makes it easy for any user to deposit withdraw their money. I also enjoy the steady feed of knowledge with whats going on in the financial world with the Academy. However, the breakdown in the investment profile could stand to be a lot more detailed instead of having to check in the statements."
StashAway,Awesome and fuss free investing.
StashAway,"Great platform for investment, good interface and information provided. Support team also responds actively and even provides frequent updates on market trends!"
StashAway,"Had no issues with depositing and withdrawal process. Returns are are better than banks FD, depending on your risk appetite that you can set within the app. Overall great experience."

StashAway,Good user experience and informative materials on financial management. Responsive customer service as well.
StashAway,"I've been using StashAway for a while and honestly, for a young investor without much capital, there couldn't be a better, more streamlined platform. All the investments are in exchange-traded funds so even the riskiest portfolios are not too risky. Highly recommended for anyone looking to gradually grow their money."
StashAway,Pleasant so far - on boarding was easy and investment returns are good so far. Recommend it for people trying to save for a milestone or just interested in investing.
StashAway,"Great app, easy to navigate."
StashAway,"Invested in SA about 7 months, overall experience are very good, not any major issue in handling our fund. And they even have active member in FB group to report/feedback bug we facing and solved it whenever they could. good!"

I just wish they could provide a higher risk portfolio (e.g. 45%).
StashAway,"Great app and good customer service, user experience could still be improved"
StashAway,Hey I'm actually quite good with the app Congratz to ur co. first as seen the update in the description!!
StashAway,User friendly interface
StashAway,"Love the great UI. Easy to get started on roboadvisory investments - you can even do it all on mobile together with your bank's mobile app. You can view the weightage of different assets for each risk profile easily. Unfortunately gold has quite a heavy weightage in the lower risk profiles, and hasn't been doing so well in recent months, so do consider that."
StashAway,"App are simple and easy use. Good customer support team. One thing to improve are investment time, hope Stashaway can invest our money in same day of USD conversion.

StashAway,"A great way to park extra cash and watch it grow. Only thing I wished was that it would show losses as well cause I do generally get confused when one day I see it has gone up then all of a sudden it goes back down, and unless I'm checking and recording on a daily basis, I won't know how much losses I've incurred. Losses is just a nature of investment and I accept that, having data on losses and not just gains would be a great addition in helping me make strategic decisions"
StashAway,Overall experience is okay. Just that when withdrawal the amount fluctuate base on the day they give and not the day u request?

StashAway,App doesnt load well & constantly shows timeout exceeded. Any methods to overcome this?
StashAway,I think this is exclusive only for Singapore and Malaysia citizens...
StashAway,"Simple, but feature rich"
StashAway,"Very user friendly, fuss free sign up and if you have any questions, the application will link you to their staff via WhatsApp. Good for beginner investors!"
StashAway,Why can't Stashaway Simple choose automatic top-up recharge
StashAway,"Very user-friendly interface and the process is simple. As a outsider like me who has no experience on investing, the WhatsApp function is so good such that i can contact the client engagement team easily. They are really approachable and always respond swiftly. Couldnt love more on the StashAway academy as it really give me an idea about financing."
StashAway,"The application is sleek and easy to navigate. I find it fuss free to set up a DCA arrantement and the team is always prompt in updating the balance. For new users, there is resources on the platform for you to learn on how to start investing! Overall, I would definitely recommend Stashaway as the go to roboadviser in Singapore"
StashAway,"[User Experience] Using the app has been relatively straightforward and is very clear. You can see the type of assets that are being invested and the allocation of the portfolio. [Returns Rate] So far, the returns has been relatively good for me. Without having to manage the portfolio, my returns are around 8%. [Investment Method] It is good to receive emails from the Stashaway teams on what is being done to rebalance the portfolio from time to time as well as the investment method that is being applied."
StashAway,Excellent
StashAway,"Signup process is really easy. For Singaporeans, you can make use of MyInfo to help simplify the sign up process. StashAway has a really clean and user friendly app, where you can monitor and make necessary changes to your portfolio all from one place. Returns from investment looks good. DCA on a monthly basis, with a risk index of 20%. Support responds really quickly via Messenger and WhatsApp. Awesome experience!"
StashAway,Rates us
StashAway,"Easy to use, understand and manage investments. I like the visuals, e.g projections of how much your money will grow according to risk level. I just wish the ddi function could try deducting again after 1 day or something. Coz i didnt register my main bank account here and on some months forget to put in the needed amount in my second acct to be deducted."
StashAway,On-boarding process is incredibly simple and straightforward. Great application if you wish to diversify your assets into international markets and commodities.
StashAway,Excellent first point of contact for investing
StashAway,Kinda cool
StashAway,Awesome apps and good customer sevice
StashAway,Excellent!
StashAway,"First robo adviser I've tried. I like the UI, very modern. I like that you can buy fractional shares of the stock so any amount you invest with is good. Their support team is also very responsive and helpful. They also release content on their blog which would be helpful to new investors :)"
StashAway,Its amazing! I have been investing with them from past 6-7 months (yes at the start of covid-19) and can't be more happy. Thier insights and educative side is amazing! and simple and transparent app is a plus! Can't ask more! Thanks so much!
StashAway,"Awesome app, well thought out UX layout and design. Extremely user friendly, color scheme of the app is nice too, in line with the colors of the company logo. The stashaway platform has helped me gained exposure to the world market in a very simple manner too. Looking forward to future products"
StashAway,I don't usually leave reviews but I'm in playstore updating my apps. I've been a user of StashAway since late 2018. Good UXUI. Easy transfer and deposit as well. Saved me a few times haha. Responsive team esp with the convenience of WhatsApp. Thank you for helping me save. (:
StashAway,Please add homescreen widget
StashAway,"Got 20$ from this apps in 5 months not bad for leisure investment, don't expect drastic positive returns if you want to use robo-advisor."
StashAway,I enjoyed using StashAway as a platform to start the habit of passive investing. The support team provided a quick response when I reach them through WhatsApp. There is also educational programmes available in the app where it greatly help newcomers like me to learn more about personal finance. Overall it's an enjoyable experience using the app but I do wish there is a more simpler access for newcomers to create higher risk level portfolios after fully understanding the risk behind it.
StashAway,Great app. Its basically a unit trust but with lower fees. The edu videos are very educational and the app it self is very user friendly. Definitely will recommend!
StashAway,"Very clean interface and easy to use. Just top up and watch it rise, out of sight out of mind."
StashAway,"Been using Stashaway almost religiously since Jan 2020 (yes, right before covid crashed the markets), and I must thank them for better educating me in personal finance, and making me actually interested to learn more. Of all the robo advisors out there now, Stash probably has the sleekest and easiest to use user interfaces out there (they do focus heavily on tech and user experience). Performance-wise, so far, so great. Do give it a try if you're considering robos."
StashAway,Useless app i've already schedule a deposit at 22 august and now im writing a complain because its been almost a week and my deposit still hasn't gone through

Keep it up Stashaway!"
StashAway,"Very clean and user friendly app, plus everything is explained clearly so I can feel at ease about investing. Have not actually encountered any issues whereby I needed to contact the client engagement team but receiving frequent updates via email to keep me in the loop is always a plus to me. Educational programmes available are very informative and easy to digest."
StashAway,"Great user interface. Fast customer support with regular insight update. The return percentage feature may be abit confusing but other than that, it has been easy to use."

StashAway,"Use a couple of robos, app is easily one of the smoothest, and most informative. Genuine effort and responses from their engagement team with prompt informative replies. Great that they provide optional education programmes as well for those who would like to know more."
StashAway,"Let's just say this is legit and not a gimmick. The app is user friendly, client engagement team is responsive and helpful. Educational programmes are amazing too!"

StashAway,"Have been using the app for almost half a year now. Tried other robo-advisors and gotta say that StashAway is the most user-friendly. It has an extremely intuitive UI with a helpful customer service to address any questions one cannot find in the app. There are also many educational programs very beneficial for beginner to intermediate investors, teaching about DCA, financial planning and when to invest."
StashAway,excellent experiences.
StashAway,"I created the account on website. Then use same email and password, could not log in with this APP! Really problem with this app"
StashAway,Okay satisfied
StashAway,Good
StashAway,"User Experience Stashaway has great user interface and beginner courses for anyone who wants to start investing. Being a roboadvisor, it helps manages ur investment to meet individual risk appetite especially during this pandemic situation."
StashAway,"Been using since Jan 2019. Great app and performance of the funds. Very responsive team as well. However an area of improvement is to be able to display an annual return. The return displayed is only since the 1st deposit. Although accurate, for the unaware, this inflates the return shown since it is over a longer duration (eg 50% return over 10 years since first deposit, but perhaps annual return may only be 6%) The statements are also monthly, there should be a yearly statement."
StashAway,I didn't received any mail about how to deposit money into your account
StashAway,Interface is easy to use and so far I am quite happy with the performance. Highly recommend for young investors who are looking for a hands off approach to investing.
StashAway,Have been trying this for the past few months. Satisfied with its performance and app has been easy to use. They also offer good customer service and other learning platforms as well which is useful.

StashAway,Tried out this robo advisor while still being new in investment. Stashaway is very beginner friendly and easy to use. Transferring money via paynow is also very easy and fast.

StashAway,I have been using this app for almost a year. I find that it has a clean and easy to navigate UI which allows me to see the current performance of my investment very easily. It is well designed for the average beginner investor. I love the investment projection graph feature to see my progress towards my financial goal.
StashAway,"The app is easy to navigate and provides all the information I need to make well informed decisions on risk management. The staff are especially friendly and would answer all questions very promptly and thoroughly.

Those education short clips are useful for beginners, and there are few online classes been conducted."
StashAway,1) app is easy to use. An explanation of currency impact would be nice inside the app 2) client engagement team is fast to respond 3)learn a lot through the podcast and you tube content.
StashAway,Great application. Overall the experience is really user friendly and straight forward. The teams in stashaway are really quick and clear. The educational programmes are great! Really thought me many things on financial planning. Great app! Will recommend to everyone.

StashAway,"Mobile app has a really sleek interface and customizable. Very easy to navigate to my portfolio and I like the fact that I am able to glance at my returns/loss and projected value in one page easily. Not cluttered with too much excess info. Would be good to be able to access more easily which ETFs my money is being funnelled into. Client engagement team is extremely efficient and friendly as well. Has the option to text or call, team got back to my query regarding fund transfer quickly within an hour via whatsapp even though I was busy and unable to pick up calls. Educational programme was a good addition that was not available way back when I first joined StashAway. I like the market insights and commentary that keeps me updated on the current financial news on the go and the analysis of it. Bite sized information that is newbie friendly and easy to digest."

StashAway,"Recommended for those that does not know much about stock market. They will allocate asset based on your risk score, and reoptomize when market is unstable. App is user friendly, and so does their customer support"
StashAway,I'm actually surprised how well the portfolio performed precovid / postcovid. Full transparency on where and how your money is invested. Appreciate the regular market updates as well to keep investors informed.

StashAway,Please help me .. i dont know how to use this stashaway...can u teach me that really great

StashAway,User friendly apps for passive investing. The customer support is great so far. Hopefully they can stay in this robo advisor industry for long.
StashAway,"Add stocks which we can buy, just like etoro. Not return 3.5% PA. I invest on stocks in etoro and i can tell you i earn more then just 3.5%. 3.5%pa is completely nonsensical. This is not investing. This is buying worthless insurance. Not recommended since its just another insurance promising peanuts in returns. Try Etoro."
StashAway,"App has a good interface and is easy to navigate. Products and accompanying risks are well explained for users in their decision making process. Fund transfers are fast and seamless. As with all investment products, it would be wise to do your research before plunging in. There are many reviews of StashAway available online."
StashAway,Overall satisfy with the customer service feedback response time. Only drawback is if you do any transactions there is a delay in reflecting your transaction. This is more noticeable when there is a public holiday in Malaysia while US is not. Correct me if I am wrong.
StashAway,Nice
StashAway,Sleek UI. Easy to use and navigate around. Since Simple MY has been added recently I would also like to see schedule deposits implemented for it as well. Keep up the excellent work.
StashAway,This stashaway app is very easy to use and very good in saving money. No regrets signing up.
StashAway,"StashAway is the first roboadviser platform that I've used as a beginner investor, and I would say my experience has been really great so far.

StashAway,Very user friendly and easy to navigate. Good for people who just started out trying investment. Highly recommended!
StashAway,User-friendly and great tool for beginning your investment journey
StashAway,A rly great app to get started on investing!!
StashAway,"[User Experience] The User Interface was simple to use, and really helped young investors such as myself. [Customer Support] Customer Support was very prompt in responding to queries, and are very helpful! Stashaway even has an ""Academy"" section where you can learn a lot about investments :)"
StashAway,The app is very intuitive and easy to use. So far everything has been quite smooth and it is friendly for beginners to roboinvesting. Customer service is also responsive.
StashAway,App is easy to use. Loving the regular updates from the team.
StashAway,"Simple and intuitive interface. A must have for beginner investors to venture into the world of robo-investing. Clear explanations too on where the allocation of money is allocated, simply great to use!"
StashAway,Happy with the returns so far
StashAway,App is clean and easy to navigate. Love that they now have recorded videos on Academy to learn more about investment in addition to the webinars. Stashaway is a great investment platform!
StashAway,"Recommended for beginners who are interested in investing but not sure how to. It allows you to adjust the risk accordingly to your desire. This platform is also user-friendly. Furthermore, it is rather flexible as it does not have a minimum deposit which is great. The returns are quite stable and have quite a diverse portfolio. Every month, a statement of all the transactions of the investments will also be sent to your email."
StashAway,"Very easy to navigate around the app. I like it when I was informed or updated for every decision made by the company, explaining why they did so. The academy section allow beginners to learn and understand about investment. In the portfolio, we can read further about the 'products' we invest too."
StashAway,[User Experience] Really intuitive UI/UX. The charts are really nice to see the difference between capital invested/current worth. I really like that they have multiple types of investments that you can choose from to suit your risks. Being able to see your asset allocation is a big boon.
StashAway,great investment saving platform and good customer service
StashAway,"Good user experience! As some of the other reviews have mentioned, it will be good to have more information like a price trend chart for the individual assets within my portfolio rather than clicking on an external link to navigate out of the app to see the price trend of the asset in browser. Also, I really love the weekly commentary. It is short and sweet, relevant and engaging. It's a big differentiation factor from other investment platforms and why I choose Stashaway. Keep it up!"
StashAway,"[User Experience] The app is pretty slick, and really easy to navigate. This was my first roboadvisor and I still think it's one of the better ones. [Customer Support] I must say that StashAway's CS is really 5/5. You can whatsapp them your questions and they usually get back within 48 hours. I am very satisfied. I have written in 3 times before and all my questions were answered every time. [Returns Rate] Due to the recent crash, they rebalanced the portfolio by selling most of the US etfs and buying EM and CN tech ETFs instead. I was quite displeased with the move because I was selling at a loss and the US market was on its way to recovery (it just did) but I wrote in asking them why and they gave a relatively satisfactory answer. I decided to ""see how"" and recently my profile turned positive again."
StashAway,Great app to use. Very transparent interface and good for me to invest my money.
StashAway,"Good Service, Trusted."
StashAway,Great app experience
StashAway,The way to invest not to difficult ...I am not expect much but what I can say is Important Thing is the money keep growing and manage well by the Team .
StashAway,Love the app. Interface easy to use and doesn't require me to really track it as the app will automatically balance the investment according to my needs.
StashAway,"Been using Stashaway for 2 years now. My portfolio has grown 10+% before the whole covid situation. What's amazing isn't the 10% growth in my portfolio. What's truly amazing is how good their algorithm is at corrections, especially in this turbulent times. They got affected, and bounced back soon after while a lot others are still taking the heat. Kudos!"
StashAway,"Very sleek UI which makes the user experience more intuitive, as compared to other apps where the screen is cluttered with graphs and numbers and charts. Would like to see more flexibility in terms of being able to adjust things like allocation by region, etc. That said, it's a promising roboinvestor to try your hand at!"
StashAway,"So far the best roboadvisor in Malaysia, easy to use and great combination of portfolios"
StashAway,Hassle free way to get invested and dollar cost average

StashAway,Great app with an intuitive and user friendly UI. Would recommend to anyone!
StashAway,"User friendly interface. Plenty of options for each individual‚Äôs investment goals and with the recent portfolio retailoring, much more exposure to the asian markets! Really happy for that. Additionally, funding and withdrawing is a seamless process. In summary, simple to use, good risk control and great investment returns for a low low price. Perfect for a new investor looking to take his first step into the investing world"
StashAway,Application is smooth and navigation is easy. They offer various courses/seminars as well. Returns have been pretty decent amidst the COVID situation.
StashAway,An excellent app to let you manage and grow your capital without needing a lot of financial knowledge!
StashAway,"Truly one of the better, if not the best, passive investment option out there. Easy, effective, and educational all with a low fee. Reoptimisation of portfolios have also proven to be very effective in navigating through the markets. Literally StashAway some money and let it compound!"
StashAway,Good platform for long term invest
StashAway,"Positive experience so far, the app is easy to use; weekly market commentary on youtube and lots of investment news shared across by the team in stashaway. Cheers!"
StashAway,Splendid platform
StashAway,The best no frills & transparent investment app
StashAway,Very user friendly.
StashAway,"I deposited $50 with the uen and my code and now its just gone i guess? Doesnt appear in my balance and hasnt appeared for more than 3 days, app basically just took my $50. Dont try. Imagine if you put a larger amount. Support also isnt responsive"
StashAway,"Practical, easy to use app for beginning investors with a great UI that makes investing on the platform easy to understand!"
StashAway,"Extremely user friendly robo advisory app. Even though I've yet to try other robo advisory, I'm loving this app! Easy to use and simple, would highly recommend for novice investor"
StashAway,An easy platform to get into investing with a small amount. Really useful platform for a new investor like myself. Love the UI!
StashAway,The app is nice but they don't fully compliant with Shariah
StashAway,App is incredibly easy to use. The same can be said with the service it provides.
StashAway,Great app for ppl who are lazy to invest
StashAway,So far so good.
StashAway,StashAway is a very convenient and straightforward robo-investment tool. Comes with a very considerate and helpful team which address and teaches newbies like myself on how to grow my finances. Highly recommend!!
StashAway,Very suitable for newbie investor that want to start with limited capital. The interface is user friendly and the app saves me lots of hassle to study and worry about my investment.
StashAway,"Great app for people to invest their money in a simple, user friendly manner."
StashAway,"StashAway has a simple on-boarding process and is super easy to use! Especially for those who want to dive into investing, this is a good platform to have a hassle-free fund which is managed by professionals in the industry. The fees are low and with the ongoing promotions + referral codes, there is no commission for first 10k for a few months! Despite the current situation, StashAway has provided me with a positive return (I have a risk profile of 36%, which is the maximum) and I intend to stick with StashAway for years to come. In addition, the app's UI is great and give a smooth experience for users!"
StashAway,Easy to use interface and MAS regulated
StashAway,Arguably one of the best robo-advisors out there. Investing is easy and the UI of the app is fantastic!
StashAway,"Great app for deposits and investments! Its an AI investing system that personalise and helps us reinvest our dividends. Most importantly, we can withdraw anytime!"
StashAway,"Clean an easy to navigate UI, which is always a big plus. Setup processes and funding were seamless as well, took no longer than a few minutes to get everything up and you'll be able to have a look around to check out their offerings! Only downside for me is the lack of actual options. Apart from varying degrees of risk, if you do a little diving into the ETFs invested, it usually centers around the same few just with different compositions. So having multiple portfolios here does not mean a different group of ETFs. That being said, I enjoyed the overall experience:)"
StashAway,Recommended. Love it !

StashAway,"Hi, am from Kenya, I downloaded the app twice and it fails,, what can I do,, thank you"
StashAway,"Best investing app for beginner, passive and long term investors. However, I hope Stashaway could add in capability to purchase individual stocks as well on top of their existing ETFs, like the one from US Digital Wealth Managers (i.e Stash and Robinhood). I want to have the opportunity to purchase individual stocks as fractional shares too."
StashAway,I can called this the best saving apps for my future. I do invest in this apps every month with a small start
StashAway,If they can delete and can't stomach negative reviews then they can steal your money as well...Very bad administration with absolutely NO professional approach to customers.
StashAway,"*I up the rating, Stashaway contacted me right away after my comment, thanks!* Original post: This app or company provides zero support, it only interested in taking money from me.

StashAway,It seems it dont support all country
StashAway,"The app has great UX/UI design which makes it user-friendly. StashAway is also a great platform for passive investing. So, if you are the kind of guy who likes to approach investing with a ""set it and forget it"" mentality, look no further than StashAway!"

StashAway,Easy to use and hassle free

StashAway,"app is very intuitive, easy to use and can see clearly what you want, when you want"
StashAway,"That's weird, the moment i request to withdraw everything the interest felt to negative value. So much for saving. Withdrawal tested and confirmed. Not sure if this app good or bad though. 1 star because my interest % hit way below bottom suddenly after withdrawal requestüòÖ"

StashAway,Got some funds invested into account but can't claim my assest on my terms only if I could get what I invested by all means they got my Bank information and got access on monthly basses why shouldn't I have access to my account I'm lock out and probely won't see a penny transfer into my account I funded the app for a few months and now we're did funds go got terminated delited or what I want some funding experience too
StashAway,Excellent
StashAway,"Customer service does not answer, withdrawal have been recorded in the app, but cash not received on my bank account while already over a week since ""transaction was completed"" in the app... scam or not? Let see if I eventually get my cash and an answer from the customer service..."
StashAway,"All is good about this app and service. But, my chief complaint is that the way one transfers money in is rather convoluted. I honestly believe it could be simplified. Transfer of money should be allowed individually to each portfolio rather than across the board and then through the app segmenting it. What's with the complication? My recommendation is to make it simpler. Other than that, maybe have a choice for app authenticator like Google's or MS's for 2fa. Anyhow keep up the good work."
StashAway,Trying to open an account but just didn't receive any message code to verify it.
StashAway,"Updated: 4 stars including good UI/UX, good management team on WhatsApp, convenience bank transfer. 1 more star for profit. Well done StashAway üí™"
StashAway,"Great app & top user experience + amazing customer support. It would be great to #1 have an app widget displaying the portfolios amount and return % without having to open the app everytime for a quick glance (please!), #2 notifications when new articles/videos are being published, #3 faster cash management to income portfolio transfers (currently 4/5 business days), #4 ways to check the ROI of the different income portfolio risks levels or simulation portfolio. Thanks and keep up the good work!"

StashAway,What is the procedure for payment
StashAway,"Recommended for Malaysians. Been using for awhile. Great investing performance and thoughtfully designed app. One downside though, as a student investing with a small initial amount, the management fee was relatively high. It could be lowered to draw more young investors. I wish the fingerprint login was allowed to fail more than once, I was forced to type in my password sometimes."
StashAway,Really great app Did all the registration and everything on the app itself. The design is simple and understandable The customer support is amazing (they're on WhatsApp!) Everything is transparent and it's influencing me to invest more :)

StashAway,The app was very user friendly with simple and easy to understand interface. The customer service was excellent. A very convenient app to use. Highly recommended.
StashAway,"User since July 2019. Easy to use investment app - good for someone who has zero knowledge on investing.

StashAway,Really easy and helpful app. Money is so well managed. And they ensure deposits withdrawn or deposited are recorded properly. It is good to also note that there is a breakdown of where the money is being invested in. Returns are safe as long as the risk profile is set lower.

StashAway,So far so good. Great investing app for beginners.
StashAway,"Easy to Sign-Up, easy to use. So far so good!"
StashAway,"Easy to use interface, they are also easily reachable should there be any questions on your portfolio or anything in general."
StashAway,"Just recently started using stashaway about 2-3 months ago. UI is simple and friendly, tools also provide enough information for any first timer to understand how to invest their first dollars through the platform. Have not invested much but currently seeing positive gains from my portfolio!"
StashAway,"Simple to use app! All you need to do is to create your risk profile, and put in money every month. So far, performance has been great!"
StashAway,Platform is easy to use and the response on whatsapp is also fast! Great app thanks!
StashAway,"So far so good, still prefer the previous design of the web layout."
StashAway,"This is an robo-investor that you can trust your funds to grow! I love how friendly it is in terms of user interface, as well as in terms of how it considers the beginner investor - by having no minimum funds, and having descriptions of every securities that's in your portfolio! Gives people things to learn about. I also really like how we get periodical newsletters from the CEO about the markets and news in general. 11/10 would recommend to anyone looking to have a better option than savings accounts!"
StashAway,"App works great, no complains"
StashAway,StashAway makes investing easy for people who do not have time to learn. Its modernised app also makes it easy to navigate around. Customer service is also readily available if you have questions.
StashAway,"I like the regular updates, and financial market commentaries. They also have very nice graphics to look at the progress of your account... And I am earning so that's a plus"
StashAway,"Intuitive UI, hassle free investing and great support. CIO posts articles into markets and performance are especially insightful. Transparent investing philosophy."
StashAway,"I love that I can easily check all the happenings of my investment portfolios in a split second with the mobile app! And it also looks sleek and has a great UX! A very good platform for passive investing, and I can have more time doing the things I love."
StashAway,"I have thoroughly enjoyed using the platform ever since I was introduced to it by my friend. It is convenient, especially so in the industry I am working in which not only restricts me from purchasing many different stocks and bonds, but does not provide me the luxury of much personal time. Thanks for the great experience. Cheers."
StashAway,"App is great, the simplicity of applying and planning of the portfolio to meet your financial goals is great!"
StashAway,App is very user friendly
StashAway,"Relatively smooth interface. Able to have a few different portfolios, with adjustable risk indexes on each. Fee structure is quite clear as well, as fees are deducted from your holdings."
StashAway,Awesome app to make sure I save and invest my money!
StashAway,"Been using stashaway for close to 6 months now. Very happy with all the recent updates as they are making the app more and more user friendly! I really appreciate the fact that stashaway gives the option to customise your investing experience such as planning for retirement, overseas trip etc etc. The customer service is generally very efficient and give good response too! The only nitpick I have is the management fee (0.8%) may be slightly expensive when you invest below 25k."
StashAway,Easy to use interface and great for beginners
StashAway,Not bad
StashAway,Easy to use and great response time!
StashAway,"Stashaway is an excellent first step towards investment. Their interface is clean and helpful, and their customer service is top-notch! My funds have performed well so far."
StashAway,"Very simple and clean UI, easy to onboard and convenient investing. The support team is very reactive to your message."
StashAway,üëåüëåüëå
StashAway,Very bad update. The new update has a lot of problem. Cannot login despite having a well functioning internet. Error keep saying network failure
StashAway,Fantastic investment platform especially for young and new investors. Seamless deposits and withdrawals and excellent app functions and designs. Continuous improvements from the team shows committment to developing the best product in the market today.
StashAway,"Easy to use, hassle free. Everyone can invest with just a finger tip"
StashAway,Great!
StashAway,"It's quick and easy to invest. However, my returns have been in negative for about a month now. Not sure how much we can trust StashAway to help us make money."
StashAway,Smooth as Pudding
StashAway,easy to use answering question in decent time
StashAway,"convincing methodology, easy to use"
StashAway,"Is there any option to reinvest dividends? Is it manual or auto? If there's isn't an auto reinvest feature, can I suggest you guys implementing that into your app? Thanks :)"
StashAway,"User friendly, great UI and great way to start investing."
StashAway,"Meets my investing needs, I like the new UI, it's more user-friendly. I do hope there's a overall performance page tho since I hold multiple portfolios and it's a pain to calculate overall performance manually(now only show how much u gain/loss in absolute dollars)"
StashAway,"Good investing app...well done... Hope you can add in more payment gateways like Internet Banking (FPX), Debit or Credit Card, or perhaps come up with your own e-wallet version...i find it quite confusing and cumbersome to deposit my cash via JomPAY, plus i have to wait like 2 days for my deposit to settle...hope you can take a look at my suggestions."
StashAway,So far so good
StashAway,Can I also invest even if I'm not from Singapore or Malaysia? I'm actually from the Philippines.
StashAway,Everything is fine. But the processing is a bit slow. Example deposits money and withdrawal money.
StashAway,Would be full star if they process money deposits faster. Great for beginners to invest who doesn't really know anything.
StashAway,excellent App
StashAway,Awesome!
StashAway,Ez to use
StashAway,"i done fill in everything and deposit, but almost one week.also havent process my deposit even whatsapp also not reply meüò°"
StashAway,My experience till now is very good. Most importantly the support is very good. I ask so many questions she always answers with the details.
StashAway,good app
StashAway,Been here for 3 months and earn back almost 4% of my invested fund. Cool ! Better than depositing money in bank @ 0.05% !
StashAway,Can this be used in the UK?
StashAway,- Easy to use the apps to invest. - Best financials apps to invest for long and short term. - Lowest annual fees annual management fee you can find. - Quality customer service. - Better return than saving and fd. I go for the lowest risk investment and I get back 0.56% time-weighted return less than 1 week and I plan to invest more next month. I wish the stashaway can reduce the management fee from 0.8% p.a to 0.75% or lower.
StashAway,i very hope Chinese version
StashAway,Good experiences
StashAway,"Great app, the UI is sleek and it's user friendly. So far, the performance of the funds are great, and it has made diversification much easier for retail investors. Not to mention the fees are lower than other fund management institutions out there. However, I would reserve judgement (and therefore one star) for the performance of the fund over the long term, as my time with the app is still insufficient."
StashAway,good UX
StashAway,Customer supoort is very helpful and efficient
StashAway,best robo investing app
StashAway,Awesome app
StashAway,"I love how it makes investing feel a lot less intimidating! Made 1.95% return on a slow growth portfolio in five days, which certainly gives better value than the annual interest on a fixed deposit. App is easy to pick up and navigate, highly recommend to give it a go."
StashAway,"i see app review, i understand this app very good. but how to do i invest my money? please tell me some experience.üôÇ"
StashAway,no comment
StashAway,"User friendly interface, beginner friendly to investment. A very friendly company. Keep up the good jobüëçüèº"
StashAway,Why like these i open new account after that i can't log in no mutch record stupid and dump these companies
StashAway,Hope for Malay language so i can understand
StashAway,good app and investment philosophy
StashAway,"Good app for investment.No minimum deposit and i think its the safest place to invest. App is simply, veryeasy to use."
StashAway,Verification Code Does Not Received.
StashAway,ok
StashAway,"Very convenient and friendly app that builds up your portfolio based on your ""Risk Adjustment"" Recommended for Investors with little to no knowledge about investing and the ones wanting to build up wealth in a long term period. Friendly customer service that reaches out to you giving reassurance, status about your account and answering your questions."
StashAway,"Overall it's very easy to use. However I like the version when it showed me detailed transactions in the ""transaction"" tab upon every successful transactions. Now I have to wait until end of month to see those details in monthly statements, which is a bit annoying."
StashAway,A brilliant platform for beginner investors!
StashAway,Easy to understand. Help is easy available. Only confusing part is the way the chart information are displayed. Information in the chart differs from pc view and mobile view.
StashAway,Its says little investment but not little...
StashAway,Great mobile app. My account has been deactivated. How do I reactivate it?
StashAway,simple to use and has made more than unit trust has for me so far. really decent management fees as well
StashAway,"sorry weak application, ask me aswer all question, in the end result rejected. scammer.."
StashAway,Friendly user interface. But i could not obtain the one time password upon registration after i have entered my details and repeated the process several times. Disappointed
StashAway,Very simple and nice way to kick start in investing. Great for beginners who knows nothing about investing. However the the fees are a little high when compared with US robo investors.
StashAway,I just updated to the latest version. It keeps crashing upon login on my galaxy s8 plus. Could you please fix it asap. Thanks. Update: problem fixed. Thanks.
StashAway,"Very nice and user-friendly UI, highly sophisticated investment framework. Great for long-term savings and investing!"
StashAway,After using it for a while I'm seeing some growth in my account. Is better than in your saving account.
StashAway,"I used this app since its first launch. I was in the first batch of waiting list. What i can say that is this app is improving day by day. Nothing wrong with the app and everything is good. But there is always room to improve. Cant easily track our IRR, we dont know how much is our weighted average cost, it does not reflect NAV easily. Basically, we need a table that show all the detail. Not just ""since inception"". Try to seperate app version and desktop version and show all details in desktop."
StashAway,I didnt receive any message for code number after fill in my information. i have tried few times still didnt work...
StashAway,apps keep crashing. disappointed.
StashAway,Unable to launch app üò§
StashAway,after new update i cannot open app
StashAway,sdsadasd
StashAway,Wonderful and easy app to use! Most cost efficient way to invest in a diversified portfolio.
StashAway,Do you have ESG-rated options? What if I want to rule out some sectors e.g. Banking?
StashAway,Great platform for investing. User-friendly! Dark mode finally!!!
StashAway,"Overall good app experience but not efficient. Money from deposit to being invested takes average 4-5 working days. They did not acknowledge receipt of fund even after IBG period (They did not process daily). Probably better if they stay true to their 1-2 day. -1. Replying your whatsapp message only when they feel like it, -1. Focus on being efficient (on everything) +1 and maybe provide investors the option to make their own portfolio / trade (side feature) would be nice. +1"
StashAway,"Just setup my account. Initial calculation from the app to achieve my 20 years retirement goal of RM3m is kind of disappointed. Suggested to monthly deposit RM11,210 for 20 years. If I do that I will save up to RM2.69m. So Stashaway only help me to make 309k for 20 years??"
StashAway,Best
StashAway,nice
StashAway,Super!
StashAway,Not too bad. Quite user friendly
StashAway,Great investing tool for the average investor with a regular monthly investing mindset. Despite some negative reviews on the net quoting that returns will be better if managed by ownself..maybe true if you can afford the time to analyze the market and always keeping up to date with the latest trend..but for the rest of the not so savvy investors..it's a great tool to make your money work harder for you!
StashAway,I love how the app is so easy to use.
StashAway,Easy to use and one of the best ways to get a diversified portfolio
StashAway,Easy to use and minimalistic. Great!
StashAway,Best robo in Singapore
StashAway,Simple to use app and it is very legit
StashAway,i changed my mind not to have stashaway
StashAway,"App is easy to use. But the investment performance is disappointing. The 
portfolio value fluctuates with the FX fluctuations and there is no FX 
hedging available. Investment return excluding FX is close to 0 after 6 
months."
StashAway,user friendly and very straight forward
StashAway,Unable to input income upon registration. So no StashAway for me.
StashAway,Great and still improving :)
StashAway,"Just wanted to sign up, but got stuck at Annual Income field, unable to 
show keypad for typing....can't proceed further"
StashAway,how do i get my money back
StashAway,"I like the idea of investing as and when you like. Just bank transfer the 
money to them and they invest for you."
StashAway,Super useless...
StashAway,Stash Away has made investing a lot simpler and transparent.
StashAway,Hassle-free passive investing coupled with a user-friendly app. Perfect!
StashAway,Well crafted and easy to use
StashAway,Snappy and Concise. Very well designed
StashAway,"Great user interface, very easy to use"
StashAway,"Great platform, great service, great app! I like the team behind StashAway and they improve the service month by month. Highly recommended!"
StashAway,"Clean interface, making it even more convenient now to check on-the-go or even make changes to the portfolios"
StashAway,Awesome!!!
StashAway,Clean and clear interface! I'm impressed :)
StashAway,Great job!
StashAway,Actually pretty good.
StashAway,Sophisticated yet elegant interface
